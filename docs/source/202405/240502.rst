Video anomaly understanding (VAU) aims to automatically comprehend unusual occurrences in videos, thereby enabling various applications such as traffic surveillance and industrial manufacturing. While existing VAU benchmarks primarily concentrate on anomaly detection and localization, our focus is on more practicality, prompting us to raise the following crucial questions: "what anomaly occurred?", "why did it happen?", and "how severe is this abnormal event?". In pursuit of these answers, we present a comprehensive benchmark for Causation Understanding of Video Anomaly (CUVA). Specifically, each instance of the proposed benchmark involves three sets of human annotations to indicate the "what", "why" and "how" of an anomaly, including 1) anomaly type, start and end times, and event descriptions, 2) natural language explanations for the cause of an anomaly, and 3) free text reflecting the effect of the abnormality. In addition, we also introduce MMEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to better align with human preferences for CUVA, facilitating the measurement of existing LLMs in comprehending the underlying cause and corresponding effect of video anomalies. Finally, we propose a novel prompt-based method that can serve as a baseline approach for the challenging CUVA. We conduct extensive experiments to show the superiority of our evaluation metric and the prompt-based approach. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/fesvhtr/CUVA.

Large language models (LLMs) suffer from low efficiency as the mismatch between the requirement of auto-regressive decoding and the design of most contemporary GPUs. Specifically, billions to trillions of parameters must be loaded to the GPU cache through its limited memory bandwidth for computation, but only a small batch of tokens is actually computed. Consequently, the GPU spends most of its time on memory transfer instead of computation. Recently, parallel decoding, a type of speculative decoding algorithms, is becoming more popular and has demonstrated impressive efficiency improvement in generation.
It introduces extra decoding heads to large models, enabling them to predict multiple subsequent tokens simultaneously and verify these candidate continuations in a single decoding step. However, this approach deviates from the training objective of next token prediction used during pre-training, resulting in a low hit rate for candidate tokens. In this paper, we propose a new speculative decoding algorithm, Clover, which integrates sequential knowledge into the parallel decoding process. This enhancement improves the hit rate of speculators and thus boosts the overall efficiency. Clover transmits the sequential knowledge from pre-speculated tokens via the Regressive Connection, then employs an Attention Decoder to integrate these speculated tokens. Additionally, Clover incorporates an Augmenting Block that modifies the hidden states to better align with the purpose of speculative generation rather than next token prediction. The experiment results demonstrate that Clover outperforms the baseline by up to 91% on Baichuan-Small and 146% on Baichuan-Large, respectively, and exceeds the performance of the previously top-performing method, Medusa, by up to 37% on Baichuan-Small and 57% on Baichuan-Large, respectively.

Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have been increasingly used by developers to boost productivity, but they often generate vulnerable code.
Thus, there is an urgent need to ensure that code generated by Code LLMs is correct and secure. Previous research has primarily focused on generating secure code, overlooking the fact that secure code also needs to be correct.
This oversight can lead to a false sense of security. Currently, the community lacks a method to measure actual progress in this area, and we need solutions that address both security and correctness of code generation.
This paper introduces a new benchmark, CodeGuard+, along with two new metrics, secure-pass@k and secure@$k_{\text{pass}}$, to measure Code LLMs' ability to generate both secure and correct code. Using our new evaluation methods, we show that the state-of-the-art defense technique, prefix tuning, may not be as strong as previously believed, since it generates secure code but sacrifices functional correctness. We also demonstrate that different decoding methods significantly affect the security of Code LLMs.
Furthermore, we explore a new defense direction: constrained decoding for secure code generation. We propose new constrained decoding techniques to generate code that satisfies security and correctness constraints simultaneously. Our results reveal that constrained decoding is more effective than prefix tuning to improve the security of Code LLMs, without requiring a specialized training dataset. Moreover, constrained decoding can be used together with prefix tuning to further improve the security of Code LLMs.

Heuristics are indispensable for tackling complex search and optimization problems. However, manual heuristic design is tedious and demands significant human intuition and experience. This paper introduces Evolution of Heuristic (EoH), a novel paradigm that leverages the synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Computation (EC) for Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD). EoH represents heuristic ideas through linguistic descriptions, termed thoughts, generated by LLMs, which are then translated into executable code representations. The coevolution of thoughts and codes within an evolutionary framework offers superior AHD performance while mitigating computational expenses. Comprehensive evaluations on three types of combinatorial optimization benchmarks demonstrate EoH's outperformance against existing AHD methods. Notably, EoH surpasses FunSearch, a concurrent work focus on code evolution, identifying superior heuristics with significantly fewer computational budgets (i.e., queries to LLMs) on online bin packing problem.

Recently, the mysterious In-Context Learning (ICL) ability exhibited by Transformer architectures, especially in large language models (LLMs), has sparked significant research interest. However, the resilience of Transformers' in-context learning capabilities in the presence of noisy samples, prevalent in both training corpora and prompt demonstrations, remains underexplored. In this paper, inspired by prior research that studies ICL ability using simple function classes, we take a closer look at this problem by investigating the robustness of Transformers against noisy labels. Specifically, we first conduct a thorough evaluation and analysis of the robustness of Transformers against noisy labels during in-context learning and show that they exhibit notable resilience against diverse types of noise in demonstration labels. Furthermore, we delve deeper into this problem by exploring whether introducing noise into the training set, akin to a form of data augmentation, enhances such robustness during inference, and find that such noise can indeed improve the robustness of ICL. Overall, our fruitful analysis and findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the resilience of Transformer models against label noises during ICL and provide valuable insights into the research on Transformers in natural language processing.

We introduce an approach aimed at enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through an iterative preference learning process inspired by the successful strategy employed by AlphaZero. Our work leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to iteratively collect preference data, utilizing its look-ahead ability to break down instance-level rewards into more granular step-level signals. To enhance consistency in intermediate steps, we combine outcome validation and stepwise self-evaluation, continually updating the quality assessment of newly generated data. The proposed algorithm employs Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to update the LLM policy using this newly generated step-level preference data. Theoretical analysis reveals the critical importance of using on-policy sampled data for successful self-improving.
Extensive evaluations on various arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks demonstrate remarkable performance improvements over existing models. For instance, our approach outperforms the Mistral-7B Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) baseline on GSM8K, MATH, and SciQ, with substantial percentage increases in accuracy to $80.7\%$ (+$4.8\%$), $32.2\%$ (+$3.3\%$), and $88.5\%$ (+$7.7\%$), respectively. Additionally, our research delves into the training and inference compute tradeoff, providing insights into how our method effectively maximizes performance gains.

The alignments of reasoning abilities between smaller and larger Language Models are largely conducted via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using demonstrations generated from robust Large Language Models (LLMs). Although these approaches deliver more performant models, they do not show sufficiently strong generalization ability as the training only relies on the provided demonstrations.
In this paper, we propose the Self-refine Instruction-tuning method that elicits Smaller Language Models to self-refine their abilities. Our approach is based on a two-stage process, where reasoning abilities are first transferred between LLMs and Small Language Models (SLMs) via Instruction-tuning on demonstrations provided by LLMs, and then the instructed models Self-refine their abilities through preference optimization strategies. In particular, the second phase operates refinement heuristics based on the Direct Preference Optimization algorithm, where the SLMs are elicited to deliver a series of reasoning paths by automatically sampling the generated responses and providing rewards using ground truths from the LLMs. Results obtained on commonsense and math reasoning tasks show that this approach significantly outperforms Instruction-tuning in both in-domain and out-domain scenarios, aligning the reasoning abilities of Smaller and Larger Language Models.

In their recent Nature Human Behaviour paper, "Emergent analogical reasoning in large language models," (Webb, Holyoak, and Lu, 2023) the authors argue that "large language models such as GPT-3 have acquired an emergent ability to find zero-shot solutions to a broad range of analogy problems." In this response, we provide counterexamples of the letter string analogies. In our tests, GPT-3 fails to solve simplest variations of the original tasks, whereas human performance remains consistently high across all modified versions. Zero-shot reasoning is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence. We do not see that evidence in our experiments. To strengthen claims of humanlike reasoning such as zero-shot reasoning, it is important that the field develop approaches that rule out data memorization.

Language technologies that accurately model the dynamics of events must perform commonsense reasoning. Existing work evaluating commonsense reasoning focuses on making inferences about common, everyday situations. To instead investigate the ability to model unusual, unexpected, and unlikely situations, we explore the task of uncommonsense abductive reasoning. Given a piece of context with an unexpected outcome, this task requires reasoning abductively to generate an explanation that makes the unexpected outcome more likely in the context. To this end, we curate and release a new English language corpus called UNcommonsense. We characterize the performance differences between human explainers and the best-performing large language models, finding that model-enhanced human-written explanations achieve the highest quality by trading off between specificity and diversity. Finally, we experiment with several imitation learning algorithms to train open and accessible language models on this task. When compared with the vanilla supervised fine-tuning approach, these methods consistently reduce lose rates on both common and uncommonsense abductive reasoning judged by human evaluators.

This paper introduces uRAG--a framework with a unified retrieval engine that serves multiple downstream retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Each RAG system consumes the retrieval results for a unique purpose, such as open-domain question answering, fact verification, entity linking, and relation extraction. We introduce a generic training guideline that standardizes the communication between the search engine and the downstream RAG systems that engage in optimizing the retrieval model. This lays the groundwork for us to build a large-scale experimentation ecosystem consisting of 18 RAG systems that engage in training and 18 unknown RAG systems that use the uRAG as the new users of the search engine. Using this experimentation ecosystem, we answer a number of fundamental research questions that improve our understanding of promises and challenges in developing search engines for machines.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have swiftly emerged as vital resources for different applications in the biomedical and healthcare domains; however, these models encounter issues such as generating inaccurate information or hallucinations. Retrieval-augmented generation provided a solution for these models to update knowledge and enhance their performance. In contrast to previous retrieval-augmented LMs, which utilize specialized cross-attention mechanisms to help LLM encode retrieved text, BiomedRAG adopts a simpler approach by directly inputting the retrieved chunk-based documents into the LLM. This straightforward design is easily applicable to existing retrieval and language models, effectively bypassing noise information in retrieved documents, particularly in noise-intensive tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential for utilizing the LLM to supervise the retrieval model in the biomedical domain, enabling it to retrieve the document that assists the LM in improving its predictions. Our experiments reveal that with the tuned scorer,\textsc{ BiomedRAG} attains superior performance across 5 biomedical NLP tasks, encompassing information extraction (triple extraction, relation extraction), text classification, link prediction, and question-answering, leveraging over 9 datasets. For instance, in the triple extraction task, \textsc{BiomedRAG} outperforms other triple extraction systems with micro-F1 scores of 81.42 and 88.83 on GIT and ChemProt corpora, respectively.

Prediction of road users' behaviors in the context of autonomous driving has gained considerable attention by the scientific community in the last years.
Most works focus on predicting behaviors based on kinematic information alone, a simplification of the reality since road users are humans, and as such they are highly influenced by their surrounding context. In addition, a large plethora of research works rely on powerful Deep Learning techniques, which exhibit high performance metrics in prediction tasks but may lack the ability to fully understand and exploit the contextual semantic information contained in the road scene, not to mention their inability to provide explainable predictions that can be understood by humans. In this work, we propose an explainable road users' behavior prediction system that integrates the reasoning abilities of Knowledge Graphs (KG) and the expressiveness capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) by using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. For that purpose, Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE) and Bayesian inference are combined to allow the deployment of a fully inductive reasoning system that enables the issuing of predictions that rely on legacy information contained in the graph as well as on current evidence gathered in real time by onboard sensors. Two use cases have been implemented following the proposed approach: 1) Prediction of pedestrians' crossing actions; 2) Prediction of lane change maneuvers. In both cases, the performance attained surpasses the current state of the art in terms of anticipation and F1-score, showing a promising avenue for future research in this field.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a method to extend beyond the pre-trained knowledge of Large Language Models by augmenting the original prompt with relevant passages or documents retrieved by an Information Retrieval (IR) system. RAG has become increasingly important for Generative AI solutions, especially in enterprise settings or in any domain in which knowledge is constantly refreshed and cannot be memorized in the LLM. We argue here that the retrieval component of RAG systems, be it dense or sparse, deserves increased attention from the research community, and accordingly, we conduct the first comprehensive and systematic examination of the retrieval strategy of RAG systems. We focus, in particular, on the type of passages IR systems within a RAG solution should retrieve. Our analysis considers multiple factors, such as the relevance of the passages included in the prompt context, their position, and their number. One counter-intuitive finding of this work is that the retriever's highest-scoring documents that are not directly relevant to the query (e.g., do not contain the answer) negatively impact the effectiveness of the LLM. Even more surprising, we discovered that adding random documents in the prompt improves the LLM accuracy by up to 35%. These results highlight the need to investigate the appropriate strategies when integrating retrieval with LLMs, thereby laying the groundwork for future research in this area.

Recent advancements in language models have demonstrated remarkable improvements in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as web navigation. Supervised learning (SL) approaches have achieved impressive performance while utilizing significantly less training data compared to previous methods. However, these SL-based models fall short when compared to reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which have shown superior results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines SL and RL techniques over the MiniWoB benchmark to leverage the strengths of both methods. We also address a critical limitation in previous models' understanding of HTML content, revealing a tendency to memorize target elements rather than comprehend the underlying structure. To rectify this, we propose methods to enhance true understanding and present a new baseline of results. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous SL methods on certain tasks using less data and narrows the performance gap with RL models, achieving 43.58\% average accuracy in SL and 36.69\% when combined with a multimodal RL approach. This study sets a new direction for future web navigation and offers insights into the limitations and potential of language modeling for computer tasks.

Recent months have seen the emergence of a powerful new trend in which large language models (LLMs) are augmented to become autonomous language agents capable of performing objective oriented multi-step tasks on their own, rather than merely responding to queries from human users. Most existing language agents, however, are not optimized using environment-specific rewards. Although some agents enable iterative refinement through verbal feedback, they do not reason and plan in ways that are compatible with gradient-based learning from rewards. This paper introduces a principled framework for reinforcing large language agents by learning a retrospective model, which automatically tunes the language agent prompts from environment feedback through policy gradient. Specifically, our proposed agent architecture learns from rewards across multiple environments and tasks, for fine-tuning a pre-trained language model which refines the language agent prompt by summarizing the root cause of prior failed attempts and proposing action plans. Experimental results on various tasks demonstrate that the language agents improve over time and that our approach considerably outperforms baselines that do not properly leverage gradients from the environment. This demonstrates that using policy gradient optimization to improve language agents, for which we believe our work is one of the first, seems promising and can be applied to optimize other models in the agent architecture to enhance agent performances over time.

Large language models are revolutionizing several areas, including artificial creativity. However, the process of generation in machines profoundly diverges from that observed in humans. In particular, machine generation is characterized by a lack of intentionality and an underlying creative process.
We propose a method called Creative Beam Search that uses Diverse Beam Search and LLM-as-a-Judge to perform response generation and response validation. The results of a qualitative experiment show how our approach can provide better output than standard sampling techniques. We also show that the response validation step is a necessary complement to the response generation step.

Addressing the challenge of automated geometry math problem-solving in artificial intelligence (AI) involves understanding multi-modal information and mathematics. Current methods struggle with accurately interpreting geometry diagrams, which hinders effective problem-solving. To tackle this issue, we present the Geometry problem sOlver with natural Language Description (GOLD) model. GOLD enhances the extraction of geometric relations by separately processing symbols and geometric primitives within the diagram. Subsequently, it converts the extracted relations into natural language descriptions, efficiently utilizing large language models to solve geometry math problems.
Experiments show that the GOLD model outperforms the Geoformer model, the previous best method on the UniGeo dataset, by achieving accuracy improvements of 12.7% and 42.1% in calculation and proving subsets. Additionally, it surpasses the former best model on the PGPS9K and Geometry3K datasets, PGPSNet, by obtaining accuracy enhancements of 1.8% and 3.2%, respectively.

Full fine-tuning is a popular approach to adapt Transformer-based pre-trained large language models to a specific downstream task. However, the substantial requirements for computational power and storage have discouraged its widespread use. Moreover, increasing evidence of catastrophic forgetting and overparameterization in the Transformer architecture has motivated researchers to seek more efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods. Commonly known parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA and BitFit are typically applied across all layers of the model. We propose a PEFT method, called Stratified Progressive Adaptation Fine-tuning (SPAFIT), based on the localization of different types of linguistic knowledge to specific layers of the model. Our experiments, conducted on nine tasks from the GLUE benchmark, show that our proposed SPAFIT method outperforms other PEFT methods while fine-tuning only a fraction of the parameters adjusted by other methods.

Many of the recent capabilities demonstrated by Large Language Models (LLMs) arise primarily from their ability to exploit contextual information. In this paper, we explore ways to improve reasoning capabilities of LLMs through (1) exploration of different chains of thought and (2) validation of the individual steps of the reasoning process. We propose three general principles that a model should adhere to while reasoning: (i) Relevance, (ii) Mathematical Accuracy, and (iii) Logical Consistency. We apply these constraints to the reasoning steps generated by the LLM to improve the accuracy of the final generation. The constraints are applied in the form of verifiers: the model itself is asked to verify if the generated steps satisfy each constraint. To further steer the generations towards high-quality solutions, we use the perplexity of the reasoning steps as an additional verifier. We evaluate our method on 4 distinct types of reasoning tasks, spanning a total of 9 different datasets. Experiments show that our method is always better than vanilla generation, and, in 6 out of the 9 datasets, it is better than best-of N sampling which samples N reasoning chains and picks the lowest perplexity generation.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in the field of code generation, offering unprecedented support for automated programming and assisting developers. However, LLMs sometimes generate code that appears plausible but fails to meet the expected requirements or executes incorrectly.
This phenomenon of hallucinations in the coding field has not been explored. To advance the community's understanding and research on code hallucinations in LLMs, we propose a definition method for these hallucinations based on execution verification and introduce the concept of code hallucinations for the first time. We categorize code hallucinations into four main types: mapping, naming, resource, and logic hallucinations, each further divided into different subcategories to better understand and address the unique challenges faced by LLMs during code generation. To systematically evaluate code hallucinations, we propose a dynamic detection algorithm for code hallucinations and construct the CodeHalu benchmark, which includes 8,883 samples from 699 tasks, to actively detect hallucination phenomena in LLMs during programming. We tested 16 popular LLMs on this benchmark to evaluate the frequency and nature of their hallucinations during code generation. The findings reveal significant variations in the accuracy and reliability of LLMs in generating code, highlighting the urgent need to improve models and training methods to ensure the functional correctness and safety of automatically generated code. This study not only classifies and quantifies code hallucinations but also provides insights for future improvements in LLM-based code generation research.

Non-cognitive skills are crucial for personal and social life well-being, and such skill development can be supported by narrative-based (e.g., storytelling) technologies. While generative AI enables interactive and role-playing storytelling, little is known about how users engage with and perceive the use of AI in social life simulation for non-cognitive skills learning. To this end, we introduced SimuLife++, an interactive platform enabled by a large language model (LLM). The system allows users to act as protagonists, creating stories with one or multiple AI-based characters in diverse social scenarios. In particular, we expanded the Human-AI interaction to a Human-AI-AI collaboration by including a sage agent, who acts as a bystander to provide users with more insightful perspectives on their choices and conversations. Through a within-subject user study, we found that the inclusion of the sage agent significantly enhanced narrative immersion, according to the narrative transportation scale, leading to more messages, particularly in group chats.
Participants' interactions with the sage agent were also associated with significantly higher scores in their perceived motivation, self-perceptions, and resilience and coping, indicating positive impacts on non-cognitive skills reflection. Participants' interview results further explained the sage agent's aid in decision-making, solving ethical dilemmas, and problem-solving; on the other hand, they suggested improvements in user control and balanced responses from multiple characters. We provide design implications on the application of generative AI in narrative solutions for non-cognitive skill development in broader social contexts.

Large language models (LLMs) that are proved to be very powerful on different NLP tasks. However, there are still many ways to attack the model with very low costs. How to defend the model becomes an important problem. In our work, we treat adversarial attack results as a new (unseen) domain of the model, and we frame the defending problem into how to improve the robustness of the model on the new domain. We focus on the task of conversation entailment, where multi-turn natural language dialogues are the premise, and the transformer model is fine-tuned to predict whether a given hypothesis about the given dialogue is true or false. The adversary would attack the hypothesis to fool the model to make the wrong predictions. We apply synonym-swapping as the attack method. To show the robustness of the model, we implement some fine-tuning strategies and propose the embedding perturbation loss as a method to improve the robustness of the model. Finally, we show the importance of our work by discussing the adversarial attacks in NLP in the real world.

Automated explanatory feedback systems play a crucial role in facilitating learning for a large cohort of learners by offering feedback that incorporates explanations, significantly enhancing the learning process. However, delivering such explanatory feedback in real-time poses challenges, particularly when high classification accuracy for domain-specific, nuanced responses is essential.
Our study leverages the capabilities of large language models, specifically Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT), to explore a sequence labeling approach focused on identifying components of desired and less desired praise for providing explanatory feedback within a tutor training dataset. Our aim is to equip tutors with actionable, explanatory feedback during online training lessons. To investigate the potential of GPT models for providing the explanatory feedback, we employed two commonly-used approaches: prompting and fine-tuning. To quantify the quality of highlighted praise components identified by GPT models, we introduced a Modified Intersection over Union (M-IoU) score. Our findings demonstrate that: (1) the M-IoU score effectively correlates with human judgment in evaluating sequence quality; (2) using two-shot prompting on GPT-3.5 resulted in decent performance in recognizing effort-based (M-IoU of 0.46) and outcome-based praise (M-IoU of 0.68); and (3) our optimally fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model achieved M-IoU scores of 0.64 for effort-based praise and 0.84 for outcome-based praise, aligning with the satisfaction levels evaluated by human coders. Our results show promise for using GPT models to provide feedback that focuses on specific elements in their open-ended responses that are desirable or could use improvement.

Large language models (LLMs) can generate long-form and coherent text, but they still frequently hallucinate facts, thus limiting their reliability. To address this issue, inference-time methods that elicit truthful responses have been proposed by shifting LLM representations towards learned "truthful directions". However, applying the truthful directions with the same intensity fails to generalize across different question contexts. We propose LITO, a Learnable Intervention method for Truthfulness Optimization that automatically identifies the optimal intervention intensity tailored to a specific context.
LITO explores a sequence of model generations based on increasing levels of intervention intensities. It selects the most accurate response or refuses to answer when the predictions are highly uncertain. Experiments on multiple LLMs and question-answering datasets demonstrate that LITO improves truthfulness while preserving task accuracy. The adaptive nature of LITO counters issues with one-size-fits-all intervention-based solutions, maximizing model truthfulness by reflecting internal knowledge only when the model is confident.

In feedback generation for logical errors in programming assignments, large language model (LLM)-based methods have shown great promise. These methods ask the LLM to generate feedback given the problem statement and a student's (buggy) submission. There are several issues with these types of methods.
First, the generated feedback messages are often too direct in revealing the error in the submission and thus diminish valuable opportunities for the student to learn. Second, they do not consider the student's learning context, i.e., their previous submissions, current knowledge, etc. Third, they are not layered since existing methods use a single, shared prompt for all student submissions. In this paper, we explore using LLMs to generate a "feedback-ladder", i.e., multiple levels of feedback for the same problem-submission pair. We evaluate the quality of the generated feedback-ladder via a user study with students, educators, and researchers. We have observed diminishing effectiveness for higher-level feedback and higher-scoring submissions overall in the study. In practice, our method enables teachers to select an appropriate level of feedback to show to a student based on their personal learning context, or in a progressive manner to go more detailed if a higher-level feedback fails to correct the student's error.

This edition introduces interventions specifically targeting the numerical, vocabulary, and semantic aspects of CTRs. Our proposed system harnesses the capabilities of the state-of-the-art Mistral model, complemented by an auxiliary model, to focus on the intricate input space of the NLI4CT dataset. Through the incorporation of numerical and acronym-based perturbations to the data, we train a robust system capable of handling both semantic-altering and numerical contradiction interventions.

Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success on many benchmarks for mathematical reasoning. However, there is growing concern that some of this performance actually reflects dataset contamination, where data closely resembling benchmark questions leaks into the training data, instead of true reasoning ability. To investigate this claim rigorously, we commission Grade School Math 1000 (GSM1k). GSM1k is designed to mirror the style and complexity of the established GSM8k benchmark, the gold standard for measuring elementary mathematical reasoning. We ensure that the two benchmarks are comparable across important metrics such as human solve rates, number of steps in solution, answer magnitude, and more. When evaluating leading open- and closed-source LLMs on GSM1k, we observe accuracy drops of up to 13%, with several families of models (e.g., Phi and Mistral) showing evidence of systematic overfitting across almost all model sizes. At the same time, many models, especially those on the frontier, (e.g., Gemini/GPT/Claude) show minimal signs of overfitting. Further analysis suggests a positive relationship (Spearman's r^2=0.32) between a model's probability of generating an example from GSM8k and its performance gap between GSM8k and GSM1k, suggesting that many models may have partially memorized GSM8k.

We introduce AdaMoLE, a novel method for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) through an Adaptive Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) Experts.
Moving beyond conventional methods that employ a static top-k strategy for activating experts, AdaMoLE dynamically adjusts the activation threshold using a dedicated threshold network, adaptively responding to the varying complexities of different tasks. By replacing a single LoRA in a layer with multiple LoRA experts and integrating a gating function with the threshold mechanism, AdaMoLE effectively selects and activates the most appropriate experts based on the input context. Our extensive evaluations across a variety of commonsense reasoning and natural language processing tasks show that AdaMoLE exceeds baseline performance. This enhancement highlights the advantages of AdaMoLE's adaptive selection of LoRA experts, improving model effectiveness without a corresponding increase in the expert count. The experimental validation not only confirms AdaMoLE as a robust approach for enhancing LLMs but also suggests valuable directions for future research in adaptive expert selection mechanisms, potentially broadening the scope for optimizing model performance across diverse language processing tasks.

Our extensive experiments suggest that such routing shows promise but is not feasible in all scenarios, so more robust approaches should be investigated to fill this gap.

Large language models (LLMs) are applied to all sorts of creative tasks, and their outputs vary from beautiful, to peculiar, to pastiche, into plain plagiarism. The temperature parameter of an LLM regulates the amount of randomness, leading to more diverse outputs; therefore, it is often claimed to be the creativity parameter. Here, we investigate this claim using a narrative generation task with a predetermined fixed context, model and prompt.
Specifically, we present an empirical analysis of the LLM output for different temperature values using four necessary conditions for creativity in narrative generation: novelty, typicality, cohesion, and coherence. We find that temperature is weakly correlated with novelty, and unsurprisingly, moderately correlated with incoherence, but there is no relationship with either cohesion or typicality. However, the influence of temperature on creativity is far more nuanced and weak than suggested by the "creativity parameter" claim; overall results suggest that the LLM generates slightly more novel outputs as temperatures get higher. Finally, we discuss ideas to allow more controlled LLM creativity, rather than relying on chance via changing the temperature parameter.

As the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have expanded dramatically, aligning these models with human values presents a significant challenge, posing potential risks during deployment. Traditional alignment strategies rely heavily on human intervention, such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), or on the self-alignment capacities of LLMs, which usually require a strong LLM's emergent ability to improve its original bad answer. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-alignment method that utilizes a Chain of Thought (CoT) approach, termed AlignCoT. This method encompasses stages of Question Analysis, Answer Guidance, and Safe Answer production. It is designed to enable LLMs to generate high-quality, safe responses throughout various stages of their development. Furthermore, we introduce the Mixture of insighTful Experts (MoTE) architecture, which applies the mixture of experts to enhance each component of the AlignCoT process, markedly increasing alignment efficiency. The MoTE approach not only outperforms existing methods in aligning LLMs with human values but also highlights the benefits of using self-generated data, revealing the dual benefits of improved alignment and training efficiency.

Large language model alignment is widely used and studied to avoid LLM producing unhelpful and harmful responses. However, the lengthy training process and predefined preference bias hinder adaptation to online diverse human preferences. To this end, this paper proposes an alignment framework, called Reinforcement Learning with Human Behavior (RLHB), to align LLMs by directly leveraging real online human behaviors. By taking the generative adversarial framework, the generator is trained to respond following expected human behavior; while the discriminator tries to verify whether the triplets of query, response, and human behavior come from real online environments.
Behavior modeling in natural-language form and the multi-model joint training mechanism enable an active and sustainable online alignment. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed methods by both human and automatic evaluations.

Gender bias research has been pivotal in revealing undesirable behaviors in large language models, exposing serious gender stereotypes associated with occupations, and emotions. A key observation in prior work is that models reinforce stereotypes as a consequence of the gendered correlations that are present in the training data. In this paper, we focus on bias where the effect from training data is unclear, and instead address the question: Do language models still exhibit gender bias in non-stereotypical settings? To do so, we introduce UnStereoEval (USE), a novel framework tailored for investigating gender bias in stereotype-free scenarios. USE defines a sentence-level score based on pretraining data statistics to determine if the sentence contain minimal word-gender associations. To systematically benchmark the fairness of popular language models in stereotype-free scenarios, we utilize USE to automatically generate benchmarks without any gender-related language. By leveraging USE's sentence-level score, we also repurpose prior gender bias benchmarks (Winobias and Winogender) for non-stereotypical evaluation.
Surprisingly, we find low fairness across all 28 tested models. Concretely, models demonstrate fair behavior in only 9%-41% of stereotype-free sentences, suggesting that bias does not solely stem from the presence of gender-related words. These results raise important questions about where underlying model biases come from and highlight the need for more systematic and comprehensive bias evaluation. We release the full dataset and code at https://ucinlp.github.io/unstereo-eval.

Automatic grading and feedback have been long studied using traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques using language models. With the recent accessibility to high performing large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA-2, there is an opportunity to investigate the use of these LLMs for automatic grading and feedback generation. Despite the increase in performance, LLMs require significant computational resources for fine-tuning and additional specific adjustments to enhance their performance for such tasks. To address these issues, Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA and QLoRA, have been adopted to decrease memory and computational requirements in model fine-tuning. This paper explores the efficacy of PEFT-based quantized models, employing classification or regression head, to fine-tune LLMs for automatically assigning continuous numerical grades to short answers and essays, as well as generating corresponding feedback. We conducted experiments on both proprietary and open-source datasets for our tasks. The results show that prediction of grade scores via finetuned LLMs are highly accurate, achieving less than 3% error in grade percentage on average. For providing graded feedback fine-tuned 4-bit quantized LLaMA-2 13B models outperform competitive base models and achieve high similarity with subject matter expert feedback in terms of high BLEU and ROUGE scores and qualitatively in terms of feedback. The findings from this study provide important insights into the impacts of the emerging capabilities of using quantization approaches to fine-tune LLMs for various downstream tasks, such as automatic short answer scoring and feedback generation at comparatively lower costs and latency.

Large language models (LLMs) with their strong zero-shot topic extraction capabilities offer an alternative to probabilistic topic modelling and closed-set topic classification approaches. As zero-shot topic extractors, LLMs are expected to understand human instructions to generate relevant and non-hallucinated topics based on the given documents. However, LLM-based topic modelling approaches often face difficulties in generating topics with adherence to granularity as specified in human instructions, often resulting in many near-duplicate topics. Furthermore, methods for addressing hallucinated topics generated by LLMs have not yet been investigated. In this paper, we focus on addressing the issues of topic granularity and hallucinations for better LLM-based topic modelling. To this end, we introduce a novel approach that leverages Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) to fine-tune open-source LLMs, such as Mistral-7B. Our approach does not rely on traditional human annotation to rank preferred answers but employs a reconstruction pipeline to modify raw topics generated by LLMs, thus enabling a fast and efficient training and inference framework. Comparative experiments show that our fine-tuning approach not only significantly improves the LLM's capability to produce more coherent, relevant, and precise topics, but also reduces the number of hallucinated topics.

Recent studies introduced effective compression techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs) via post-training quantization or low-bit weight representation.
Although quantized weights offer storage efficiency and allow for faster inference, existing works have indicated that quantization might compromise performance and exacerbate biases in LLMs. This study investigates the confidence and calibration of quantized models, considering factors such as language model type and scale as contributors to quantization loss. Firstly, we reveal that quantization with GPTQ to 4-bit results in a decrease in confidence regarding true labels, with varying impacts observed among different language models. Secondly, we observe fluctuations in the impact on confidence across different scales. Finally, we propose an explanation for quantization loss based on confidence levels, indicating that quantization disproportionately affects samples where the full model exhibited low confidence levels in the first place.

This study presents a targeted model editing analysis focused on the latest large language model, Llama-3. We explore the efficacy of popular model editing techniques - ROME, MEMIT, and EMMET, which are designed for precise layer interventions. We identify the most effective layers for targeted edits through an evaluation that encompasses up to 4096 edits across three distinct strategies: sequential editing, batch editing, and a hybrid approach we call as sequential-batch editing. Our findings indicate that increasing edit batch-sizes may degrade model performance more significantly than using smaller edit batches sequentially for equal number of edits. With this, we argue that sequential model editing is an important component for scaling model editing methods and future research should focus on methods that combine both batched and sequential editing. This observation suggests a potential limitation in current model editing methods which push towards bigger edit batch sizes, and we hope it paves way for future investigations into optimizing batch sizes and model editing performance.

Traditional reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) approaches relying on parametric models like the Bradley-Terry model fall short in capturing the intransitivity and irrationality in human preferences. Recent advancements suggest that directly working with preference probabilities can yield a more accurate reflection of human preferences, enabling more flexible and accurate language model alignment. In this paper, we propose a self-play-based method for language model alignment, which treats the problem as a constant-sum two-player game aimed at identifying the Nash equilibrium policy. Our approach, dubbed \textit{Self-Play Preference Optimization} (SPPO), approximates the Nash equilibrium through iterative policy updates and enjoys theoretical convergence guarantee. Our method can effectively increase the log-likelihood of the chosen response and decrease that of the rejected response, which cannot be trivially achieved by symmetric pairwise loss such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Identity Preference Optimization (IPO). In our experiments, using only 60k prompts (without responses) from the UltraFeedback dataset and without any prompt augmentation, by leveraging a pre-trained preference model PairRM with only 0.4B parameters, SPPO can obtain a model from fine-tuning Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 that achieves the state-of-the-art length-controlled win-rate of 28.53% against GPT-4-Turbo on AlpacaEval 2.0. It also outperforms the (iterative) DPO and IPO on MT-Bench and the Open LLM Leaderboard. Notably, the strong performance of SPPO is achieved without additional external supervision (e.g., responses, preferences, etc.) from GPT-4 or other stronger language models.

Recently, interpreting complex charts with logical reasoning have emerged as challenges due to the development of vision-language models. A prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, Deplot, has presented an end-to-end method that leverages the vision-language model to convert charts into table format utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning. However, unlike natural images, charts contain a mix of essential and irrelevant information required for chart reasoning, and we discover that this characteristic can lower the performance of chart-to-table extraction. In this paper, we introduce SIMPLOT, a method designed to extract only the elements necessary for chart reasoning.
The proposed method involves two steps: 1) training to mimic a simple plot that contains only the essential information from a complex chart for table extraction, followed by 2) performing reasoning based on the table. Our model enables accurate chart reasoning without the need for additional annotations or datasets, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through various experiments.
Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt addressing the shortcoming of recent SOTA model, ignoring visual attributes such as color. Our source code is available at https://github.com/sangwu99/Simplot.

Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing through audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the application of language modelling techniques to audio data. However, traditional codecs often operate at high bitrates or within narrow domains such as speech and lack the semantic clues required for efficient language modelling. Addressing these challenges, we introduce SemantiCodec, a novel codec designed to compress audio into fewer than a hundred tokens per second across diverse audio types, including speech, general audio, and music, without compromising quality. SemantiCodec features a dual-encoder architecture: a semantic encoder using a self-supervised AudioMAE, discretized using k-means clustering on extensive audio data, and an acoustic encoder to capture the remaining details. The semantic and acoustic encoder outputs are used to reconstruct audio via a diffusion-model-based decoder. SemantiCodec is presented in three variants with token rates of 25, 50, and 100 per second, supporting a range of ultra-low bit rates between 0.31 kbps and 1.43 kbps.
Experimental results demonstrate that SemantiCodec significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art Descript codec on reconstruction quality. Our results also suggest that SemantiCodec contains significantly richer semantic information than all evaluated audio codecs, even at significantly lower bitrates. Our code and demos are available at https://haoheliu.github.io/SemantiCodec/.

Learning never ends, and there is no age limit to grow yourself. However, the educational landscape may face challenges in effectively catering to students' inclusion and diverse learning needs. These students should have access to state-of-the-art methods for lecture delivery, online resources, and technology needs. However, with all the diverse learning sources, it becomes harder for students to comprehend a large amount of knowledge in a short period of time.
Traditional assistive technologies and learning aids often lack the dynamic adaptability required for individualized education plans. Large Language Models (LLM) have been used in language translation, text summarization, and content generation applications. With rapid growth in AI over the past years, AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants have been developed. This research aims to bridge this gap by introducing an innovative study buddy we will be calling the 'SAMCares'. The system leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) (in our case, LLaMa-2 70B as the base model) and Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) to offer real-time, context-aware, and adaptive educational support. The context of the model will be limited to the knowledge base of Sam Houston State University (SHSU) course notes. The LLM component enables a chat-like environment to interact with it to meet the unique learning requirements of each student. For this, we will build a custom web-based GUI. At the same time, RAG enhances real-time information retrieval and text generation, in turn providing more accurate and context-specific assistance. An option to upload additional study materials in the web GUI is added in case additional knowledge support is required. The system's efficacy will be evaluated through controlled trials and iterative feedback mechanisms.

Ultrasound robots are increasingly used in medical diagnostics and early disease screening. However, current ultrasound robots lack the intelligence to understand human intentions and instructions, hindering autonomous ultrasound scanning. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Ultrasound Embodied Intelligence system that equips ultrasound robots with the large language model (LLM) and domain knowledge, thereby improving the efficiency of ultrasound robots. Specifically, we first design an ultrasound operation knowledge database to add expertise in ultrasound scanning to the LLM, enabling the LLM to perform precise motion planning. Furthermore, we devise a dynamic ultrasound scanning strategy based on a \textit{think-observe-execute} prompt engineering, allowing LLMs to dynamically adjust motion planning strategies during the scanning procedures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system significantly improves ultrasound scan efficiency and quality from verbal commands. This advancement in autonomous medical scanning technology contributes to non-invasive diagnostics and streamlined medical workflows.

Widely deployed large language models (LLMs) can produce convincing yet incorrect outputs, potentially misleading users who may rely on them as if they were correct. To reduce such overreliance, there have been calls for LLMs to communicate their uncertainty to end users. However, there has been little empirical work examining how users perceive and act upon LLMs' expressions of uncertainty. We explore this question through a large-scale, pre-registered, human-subject experiment (N=404) in which participants answer medical questions with or without access to responses from a fictional LLM-infused search engine.
Using both behavioral and self-reported measures, we examine how different natural language expressions of uncertainty impact participants' reliance, trust, and overall task performance. We find that first-person expressions (e.g., "I'm not sure, but...") decrease participants' confidence in the system and tendency to agree with the system's answers, while increasing participants' accuracy. An exploratory analysis suggests that this increase can be attributed to reduced (but not fully eliminated) overreliance on incorrect answers. While we observe similar effects for uncertainty expressed from a general perspective (e.g., "It's not clear, but..."), these effects are weaker and not statistically significant. Our findings suggest that using natural language expressions of uncertainty may be an effective approach for reducing overreliance on LLMs, but that the precise language used matters. This highlights the importance of user testing before deploying LLMs at scale.

Recently, many works have proposed various financial large language models (FinLLMs) by pre-training from scratch or fine-tuning open-sourced LLMs on financial corpora. However, existing FinLLMs exhibit unsatisfactory performance in understanding financial text when numeric variables are involved in questions. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM, called numeric-sensitive large language model (NumLLM), for Chinese finance. We first construct a financial corpus from financial textbooks which is essential for improving numeric capability of LLMs during fine-tuning. After that, we train two individual low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules by fine-tuning on our constructed financial corpus. One module is for adapting general-purpose LLMs to financial domain, and the other module is for enhancing the ability of NumLLM to understand financial text with numeric variables. Lastly, we merge the two LoRA modules into the foundation model to obtain NumLLM for inference. Experiments on financial question-answering benchmark show that NumLLM can boost the performance of the foundation model and can achieve the best overall performance compared to all baselines, on both numeric and non-numeric questions.

As large language models (LLMs) develop ever-improving capabilities and are applied in real-world settings, it is important to understand their safety. While initial steps have been taken to evaluate the safety of general-knowledge LLMs, exposing some weaknesses, the safety of medical LLMs has not been sufficiently evaluated despite their high risks to personal health and safety, public health and safety, patient rights, and human rights. To address this gap, we conduct, to our knowledge, the first study of its kind to evaluate and improve the safety of medical LLMs. We find that 1) current medical LLMs do not meet standards of general or medical safety, as they readily comply with harmful requests and that 2) fine-tuning medical LLMs on safety demonstrations significantly improves their safety, reducing their tendency to comply with harmful requests. In addition, we present a definition of medical safety for LLMs and develop a benchmark dataset to evaluate and train for medical safety in LLMs. Poised at the intersection of research on machine learning safety and medical machine learning, this work casts light on the status quo of the safety of medical LLMs and motivates future work in this area, mitigating the risks of harm of LLMs in medicine.

LLMs trained in the understanding of programming syntax are now providing effective assistance to developers and are being used in programming education such as in generation of coding problem examples or providing code explanations. A key aspect of programming education is understanding and dealing with error message. However, 'logical errors' in which the program operates against the programmer's intentions do not receive error messages from the compiler. In this study, building on existing research on programming errors, we first define the types of logical errors that can occur in programming in general. Based on the definition, we propose an effective approach for detecting logical errors with LLMs that makes use of relations among error types in the Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought prompts. The experimental results indicate that when such logical error descriptions in the prompt are used, the average classifition performance is about 21% higher than the ones without them. We also conducted an experiment for exploiting the relations among errors in generating a new logical error dataset using LLMs. As there is very limited dataset for logical errors such benchmark dataset can be very useful for various programming related applications. We expect that our work can assist novice programmers in identifying the causes of code errors and correct them more effectively.

We introduce a novel writing method called Probing Chain-of-Thought (ProCoT), which potentially prevents students from cheating using a Large Language Model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, while enhancing their active learning. LLMs have disrupted education and many other fields. For fear of students cheating, many have resorted to banning their use. These LLMs are also known for hallucinations. We conduct studies with ProCoT in two different courses with 65 students. The students in each course were asked to prompt an LLM of their choice with one question from a set of four and required to affirm or refute statements in the LLM output by using peer-reviewed references. The results show two things: (1) ProCoT stimulates creative/critical thinking and writing of students through engagement with LLMs when we compare the LLM-only output to ProCoT output and (2) ProCoT can prevent cheating because of clear limitations in existing LLMs, particularly ChatGPT, when we compare students' ProCoT output to LLM ProCoT output. We also discover that most students prefer to give answers in fewer words than LLMs, which are typically verbose. The average word counts for students in the first course, ChatGPT (v3.5), and Phind (v8) are 208, 391 and 383, respectively.

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent in conversational systems due to their advanced understanding and generative capabilities in general contexts. However, their effectiveness in task-oriented dialogues (TOD), which requires not only response generation but also effective dialogue state tracking (DST) within specific tasks and domains, remains less satisfying. In this work, we propose a novel approach FnCTOD for solving DST with LLMs through function calling. This method improves zero-shot DST, allowing adaptation to diverse domains without extensive data collection or model tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves exceptional performance with both modestly sized open-source and also proprietary LLMs: with in-context prompting it enables various 7B or 13B parameter models to surpass the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) achieved by ChatGPT, and improves ChatGPT's performance beating the SOTA by 5.6% average joint goal accuracy (JGA). Individual model results for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are boosted by 4.8% and 14%, respectively. We also show that by fine-tuning on a small collection of diverse task-oriented dialogues, we can equip modestly sized models, specifically a 13B parameter LLaMA2-Chat model, with function-calling capabilities and DST performance comparable to ChatGPT while maintaining their chat capabilities.

Real-world misinformation can be partially correct and even factual but misleading. It undermines public trust in science and democracy, particularly on social media, where it can spread rapidly. High-quality and timely correction of misinformation that identifies and explains its (in)accuracies has been shown to effectively reduce false beliefs. Despite the wide acceptance of manual correction, it is difficult to be timely and scalable, a concern as technologies like large language models (LLMs) make misinformation easier to produce. LLMs also have versatile capabilities that could accelerate misinformation correction-however, they struggle due to a lack of recent information, a tendency to produce false content, and limitations in addressing multimodal information. We propose MUSE, an LLM augmented with access to and credibility evaluation of up-to-date information. By retrieving evidence as refutations or contexts, MUSE identifies and explains (in)accuracies in a piece of content-not presupposed to be misinformation-with references. It also describes images and conducts multimodal searches to verify and correct multimodal content. Fact-checking experts evaluate responses to social media content that are not presupposed to be (non-)misinformation but broadly include incorrect, partially correct, and correct posts, that may or may not be misleading. We propose and evaluate 13 dimensions of misinformation correction quality, ranging from the accuracy of identifications and factuality of explanations to the relevance and credibility of references. The results demonstrate MUSE's ability to promptly write high-quality responses to potential misinformation on social media-overall, MUSE outperforms GPT-4 by 37% and even high-quality responses from laypeople by 29%. This work reveals LLMs' potential to help combat real-world misinformation effectively and efficiently.

Large language models (LLMs) have a surprising failure: when trained on "A has a feature B", they do not generalize to "B is a feature of A", which is termed the Reversal Curse. Even when training with trillions of tokens this issue still appears due to Zipf's law - hence even if we train on the entire internet. This work proposes an alternative training scheme, called reverse training, whereby all words are used twice, doubling the amount of available tokens. The LLM is trained in both forward and reverse directions by reversing the training strings while preserving (i.e., not reversing) chosen substrings, such as entities. We show that data-matched reverse-trained models provide superior performance to standard models on standard tasks, and compute-matched reverse-trained models provide far superior performance on reversal tasks, helping resolve the reversal curse issue.

Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performances across a wide range of tasks. However, the mechanisms by which these models encode tasks of varying complexities remain poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that LLMs process concepts of varying complexities in different layers, introducing the idea of "Concept Depth" to suggest that more complex concepts are typically acquired in deeper layers. Specifically, we categorize concepts based on their level of abstraction, defining them in the order of increasing complexity within factual, emotional, and inferential tasks. We conduct extensive probing experiments using layer-wise representations across various LLM families (Gemma, LLaMA, QWen) on various datasets spanning the three domains of tasks. Our findings reveal that models could efficiently conduct probing for simpler tasks in shallow layers, and more complex tasks typically necessitate deeper layers for accurate understanding. Additionally, we examine how external factors, such as adding noise to the input and quantizing the model weights, might affect layer-wise representations. Our findings suggest that these factors can impede the development of a conceptual understanding of LLMs until deeper layers are explored. We hope that our proposed concept and experimental insights will enhance the understanding of the mechanisms underlying LLMs. Our codes are available at this https URL.

As Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more advanced, they have outpaced our abilities to accurately evaluate their quality. Not only is finding data to adequately probe particular model properties difficult, but evaluating the correctness of a model's freeform generation alone is a challenge. To address this, many evaluations now rely on using LLMs themselves as judges to score the quality of outputs from other LLMs. Evaluations most commonly use a single large model like GPT4. While this method has grown in popularity, it is costly, has been shown to introduce intramodel bias, and in this work, we find that very large models are often unnecessary. We propose instead to evaluate models using a Panel of LLm evaluators (PoLL). Across three distinct judge settings and spanning six different datasets, we find that using a PoLL composed of a larger number of smaller models outperforms a single large judge, exhibits less intra-model bias due to its composition of disjoint model families, and does so while being over seven times less expensive.

Tabular data prediction has been employed in medical applications such as patient health risk prediction. However, existing methods usually revolve around the algorithm design while overlooking the significance of data engineering. Medical tabular datasets frequently exhibit significant heterogeneity across different sources, with limited sample sizes per source. As such, previous predictors are often trained on manually curated small datasets that struggle to generalize across different tabular datasets during inference. This paper proposes to scale medical tabular data predictors (MediTab) to various tabular inputs with varying features. The method uses a data engine that leverages large language models (LLMs) to consolidate tabular samples to overcome the barrier across tables with distinct schema. It also aligns out-domain data with the target task using a "learn, annotate, and refinement" pipeline. The expanded training data then enables the pre-trained MediTab to infer for arbitrary tabular input in the domain without fine-tuning, resulting in significant improvements over supervised baselines: it reaches an average ranking of 1.57 and 1.00 on 7 patient outcome prediction datasets and 3 trial outcome prediction datasets, respectively. In addition, MediTab exhibits impressive zero-shot performances: it outperforms supervised XGBoost models by 8.9% and 17.2% on average in two prediction tasks, respectively.

This paper studies the alignment process of generative models with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We first identify the primary challenges of existing popular methods like offline PPO and offline DPO as lacking in strategical exploration of the environment. Then, to understand the mathematical principle of RLHF, we consider a standard mathematical formulation, the reverse-KL regularized contextual bandit for RLHF. Despite its widespread practical application, a rigorous theoretical analysis of this formulation remains open. We investigate its behavior in three distinct settings -- offline, online, and hybrid -- and propose efficient algorithms with finite-sample theoretical guarantees.
Moving towards practical applications, our framework, with a robust approximation of the information-theoretical policy improvement oracle, naturally gives rise to several novel RLHF algorithms. This includes an iterative version of the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm for online settings, and a multi-step rejection sampling strategy for offline scenarios. Our empirical evaluations on real-world alignment experiment of large language model demonstrate that these proposed methods significantly surpass existing strong baselines, such as DPO and Rejection Sampling Optimization (RSO), showcasing the connections between solid theoretical foundations and their potent practical implementations.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled as high-level semantic planners for sequential decision-making tasks. However, harnessing them to learn complex low-level manipulation tasks, such as dexterous pen spinning, remains an open problem. We bridge this fundamental gap and present Eureka, a human-level reward design algorithm powered by LLMs. Eureka exploits the remarkable zero-shot generation, code-writing, and in-context improvement capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4, to perform evolutionary optimization over reward code. The resulting rewards can then be used to acquire complex skills via reinforcement learning. Without any task-specific prompting or pre-defined reward templates, Eureka generates reward functions that outperform expert human-engineered rewards. In a diverse suite of 29 open-source RL environments that include 10 distinct robot morphologies, Eureka outperforms human experts on 83% of the tasks, leading to an average normalized improvement of 52%. The generality of Eureka also enables a new gradient-free in-context learning approach to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), readily incorporating human inputs to improve the quality and the safety of the generated rewards without model updating. Finally, using Eureka rewards in a curriculum learning setting, we demonstrate for the first time, a simulated Shadow Hand capable of performing pen spinning tricks, adeptly manipulating a pen in circles at rapid speed.

In the largest survey of its kind, 2,778 researchers who had published in top-tier artificial intelligence (AI) venues gave predictions on the pace of AI progress and the nature and impacts of advanced AI systems The aggregate forecasts give at least a 50% chance of AI systems achieving several milestones by 2028, including autonomously constructing a payment processing site from scratch, creating a song indistinguishable from a new song by a popular musician, and autonomously downloading and fine-tuning a large language model. If science continues undisrupted, the chance of unaided machines outperforming humans in every possible task was estimated at 10% by 2027, and 50% by 2047. The latter estimate is 13 years earlier than that reached in a similar survey we conducted only one year earlier [Grace et al., 2022]. However, the chance of all human occupations becoming fully automatable was forecast to reach 10% by 2037, and 50% as late as 2116 (compared to 2164 in the 2022 survey).
Most respondents expressed substantial uncertainty about the long-term value of AI progress: While 68.3% thought good outcomes from superhuman AI are more likely than bad, of these net optimists 48% gave at least a 5% chance of extremely bad outcomes such as human extinction, and 59% of net pessimists gave 5% or more to extremely good outcomes. Between 38% and 51% of respondents gave at least a 10% chance to advanced AI leading to outcomes as bad as human extinction. More than half suggested that "substantial" or "extreme" concern is warranted about six different AI-related scenarios, including misinformation, authoritarian control, and inequality. There was disagreement about whether faster or slower AI progress would be better for the future of humanity. However, there was broad agreement that research aimed at minimizing potential risks from AI systems ought to be prioritized more.

Current course recommender systems primarily leverage learner-course interactions, course content, learner preferences, and supplementary course details like instructor, institution, ratings, and reviews, to make their recommendation. However, these systems often overlook a critical aspect: the evolving skill demand of the job market. This paper focuses on the perspective of academic researchers, working in collaboration with the industry, aiming to develop a course recommender system that incorporates job market skill demands. In light of the job market's rapid changes and the current state of research in course recommender systems, we outline essential properties for course recommender systems to address these demands effectively, including explainable, sequential, unsupervised, and aligned with the job market and user's goals. Our discussion extends to the challenges and research questions this objective entails, including unsupervised skill extraction from job listings, course descriptions, and resumes, as well as predicting recommendations that align with learner objectives and the job market and designing metrics to evaluate this alignment. Furthermore, we introduce an initial system that addresses some existing limitations of course recommender systems using large Language Models (LLMs) for skill extraction and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for alignment with the job market. We provide empirical results using open-source data to demonstrate its effectiveness.
