The potential of Machine Learning Control (MLC) in HVAC systems is hindered by its opaque nature and inference mechanisms, which is challenging for users and modelers to fully comprehend, ultimately leading to a lack of trust in MLC-based decision-making. To address this challenge, this paper investigates and explores Interpretable Machine Learning (IML), a branch of Machine Learning (ML) that enhances transparency and understanding of models and their inferences, to improve the credibility of MLC and its industrial application in HVAC systems. Specifically, we developed an innovative framework that combines the principles of Shapley values and the in-context learning feature of Large Language Models (LLMs). While the Shapley values are instrumental in dissecting the contributions of various features in ML models, LLM provides an in-depth understanding of rule-based parts in MLC; combining them, LLM further packages these insights into a coherent, human-understandable narrative. The paper presents a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of the developed IML framework for model predictive control-based precooling under demand response events in a virtual testbed. The results indicate that the developed framework generates and explains the control signals in accordance with the rule-based rationale.

A drug molecule is a substance that changes the organism's mental or physical state. Every approved drug has an indication, which refers to the therapeutic use of that drug for treating a particular medical condition. While the Large Language Model (LLM), a generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique, has recently demonstrated effectiveness in translating between molecules and their textual descriptions, there remains a gap in research regarding their application in facilitating the translation between drug molecules and indications, or vice versa, which could greatly benefit the drug discovery process. The capability of generating a drug from a given indication would allow for the discovery of drugs targeting specific diseases or targets and ultimately provide patients with better treatments. In this paper, we first propose a new task, which is the translation between drug molecules and corresponding indications, and then test existing LLMs on this new task.
Specifically, we consider nine variations of the T5 LLM and evaluate them on two public datasets obtained from ChEMBL and DrugBank. Our experiments show the early results of using LLMs for this task and provide a perspective on the state-of-the-art. We also emphasize the current limitations and discuss future work that has the potential to improve the performance on this task. The creation of molecules from indications, or vice versa, will allow for more efficient targeting of diseases and significantly reduce the cost of drug discovery, with the potential to revolutionize the field of drug discovery in the era of generative AI.

The extraordinary performance of large language models has not only reshaped the research landscape in the field of NLP but has also demonstrated its exceptional applicative potential in various domains. However, the potential of these models in mining relationships from graph data remains under-explored.
Graph neural networks, as a popular research area in recent years, have numerous studies on relationship mining. Yet, current cutting-edge research in graph neural networks has not been effectively integrated with large language models, leading to limited efficiency and capability in graph relationship mining tasks. A primary challenge is the inability of LLMs to deeply exploit the edge information in graphs, which is critical for understanding complex node relationships. This gap limits the potential of LLMs to extract meaningful insights from graph structures, limiting their applicability in more complex graph-based analysis. We focus on how to utilize existing LLMs for mining and understanding relationships in graph data, applying these techniques to recommendation tasks. We propose an innovative framework that combines the strong contextual representation capabilities of LLMs with the relationship extraction and analysis functions of GNNs for mining relationships in graph data. Specifically, we design a new prompt construction framework that integrates relational information of graph data into natural language expressions, aiding LLMs in more intuitively grasping the connectivity information within graph data. Additionally, we introduce graph relationship understanding and analysis functions into LLMs to enhance their focus on connectivity information in graph data. Our evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates the framework's ability to understand connectivity information in graph data.

This study investigates GPT-4's assessment of its performance in healthcare applications. A simple prompting technique was used to prompt the LLM with questions taken from the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) questionnaire and it was tasked to evaluate its confidence score before posing the question and after asking the question. The questionnaire was categorized into two groups-questions with feedback (WF) and questions with no feedback(NF) post-question. The model was asked to provide absolute and relative confidence scores before and after each question. The experimental findings were analyzed using statistical tools to study the variability of confidence in WF and NF groups. Additionally, a sequential analysis was conducted to observe the performance variation for the WF and NF groups. Results indicate that feedback influences relative confidence but doesn't consistently increase or decrease it. Understanding the performance of LLM is paramount in exploring its utility in sensitive areas like healthcare. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the reliability of AI, particularly of LLMs like GPT-4, within healthcare, offering insights into how feedback mechanisms might be optimized to enhance AI-assisted medical education and decision support.

Although model editing has shown promise in revising knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs), its impact on the inherent capabilities of LLMs is often overlooked. In this work, we reveal a critical phenomenon: even a single edit can trigger model collapse, manifesting as significant performance degradation in various benchmark tasks. However, benchmarking LLMs after each edit, while necessary to prevent such collapses, is impractically time-consuming and resource-intensive. To mitigate this, we propose using perplexity as a surrogate metric, validated by extensive experiments demonstrating its strong correlation with downstream task performance. We further conduct an in-depth study on sequential editing, a practical setting for real-world scenarios, across various editing methods and LLMs, focusing on hard cases from our previous single edit studies. The results indicate that nearly all examined editing methods result in model collapse after only few edits. To facilitate further research, we have utilized ChatGPT to develop a new dataset, HardCF, based on those hard cases. This dataset aims to establish the foundation for pioneering research in reliable model editing and the mechanisms underlying editing-induced model collapse. We hope this work can draw the community's attention to the potential risks inherent in model editing practices.

Deep Reinforcement Learning is widely used for aligning Large Language Models (LLM) with human preference. However, the conventional reward modelling has predominantly depended on human annotations provided by a select cohort of individuals. Such dependence may unintentionally result in models that are skewed to reflect the inclinations of these annotators, thereby failing to represent the expectations of the wider population adequately. In this paper, we introduce the Distributional Preference Reward Model (DPRM), a simple yet effective framework to align large language models with a diverse set of human preferences. To this end, we characterize the preferences by a beta distribution, which can dynamically adapt to fluctuations in preference trends.
On top of that, we design an optimal-transportation-based loss to calibrate DPRM to align with the preference distribution. Finally, the expected reward is utilized to fine-tune an LLM policy to generate responses favoured by the population. Our experiments show that DPRM significantly enhances the alignment of LLMs with population preference, yielding more accurate, unbiased, and contextually appropriate responses.

Human mobility behaviours are closely linked to various important societal problems such as traffic congestion, and epidemic control. However, collecting mobility data can be prohibitively expensive and involves serious privacy issues, posing a pressing need for high-quality generative mobility models.
Previous efforts focus on learning the behaviour distribution from training samples, and generate new mobility data by sampling the learned distributions.
They cannot effectively capture the coherent intentions that drive mobility behavior, leading to low sample efficiency and semantic-awareness. Inspired by the emergent reasoning ability in LLMs, we propose a radical perspective shift that reformulates mobility generation as a commonsense reasoning problem. In this paper, we design a novel Mobility Generation as Reasoning (MobiGeaR) framework that prompts LLM to recursively generate mobility behaviour.
Specifically, we design a context-aware chain-of-thoughts prompting technique to align LLMs with context-aware mobility behaviour by few-shot in-context learning. Besides, MobiGeaR employ a divide-and-coordinate mechanism to exploit the synergistic effect between LLM reasoning and mechanistic gravity model. It leverages the step-by-step LLM reasoning to recursively generate a temporal template of activity intentions, which are then mapped to physical locations with a mechanistic gravity model. Experiments on two real-world datasets show MobiGeaR achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics, and substantially reduces the size of training samples at the same time. Besides, MobiGeaR also significantly improves the semantic-awareness of mobility generation by improving the intention accuracy by 62.23% and the generated mobility data is proven effective in boosting the performance of downstream applications. The implementation of our approach is available in the paper.

The rapid rise in popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) with emerging capabilities has spurred public curiosity to evaluate and compare different LLMs, leading many researchers to propose their LLM benchmarks. Noticing preliminary inadequacies in those benchmarks, we embarked on a study to critically assess 23 state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, using our novel unified evaluation framework through the lenses of people, process, and technology, under the pillars of functionality and security. Our research uncovered significant limitations, including biases, difficulties in measuring genuine reasoning, adaptability, implementation inconsistencies, prompt engineering complexity, evaluator diversity, and the overlooking of cultural and ideological norms in one comprehensive assessment. Our discussions emphasized the urgent need for standardized methodologies, regulatory certainties, and ethical guidelines in light of Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements, including advocating for an evolution from static benchmarks to dynamic behavioral profiling to accurately capture LLMs' complex behaviors and potential risks. Our study highlighted the necessity for a paradigm shift in LLM evaluation methodologies, underlining the importance of collaborative efforts for the development of universally accepted benchmarks and the enhancement of AI systems' integration into society.

The construction industry is a vital sector of the global economy, but it faces many productivity challenges in various processes, such as design, planning, procurement, inspection, and maintenance. Generative artificial intelligence (AI), which can create novel and realistic data or content, such as text, image, video, or code, based on some input or prior knowledge, offers innovative and disruptive solutions to address these challenges. However, there is a gap in the literature on the current state, opportunities, and challenges of generative AI in the construction industry. This study aims to fill this gap by providing a state-of-the-art analysis of generative AI in construction, with three objectives: (1) to review and categorize the existing and emerging generative AI opportunities and challenges in the construction industry; (2) to propose a framework for construction firms to build customized generative AI solutions using their own data, comprising steps such as data collection, dataset curation, training custom large language model (LLM), model evaluation, and deployment; and (3) to demonstrate the framework via a case study of developing a generative model for querying contract documents. The results show that retrieval augmented generation (RAG) improves the baseline LLM by 5.2, 9.4, and 4.8% in terms of quality, relevance, and reproducibility. This study provides academics and construction professionals with a comprehensive analysis and practical framework to guide the adoption of generative AI techniques to enhance productivity, quality, safety, and sustainability across the construction industry.

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) provides an effective yet efficient solution for fine-tuning large language models (LLM). The modular and plug-and-play nature of LoRA enables the integration of diverse domain-specific LoRAs to enhance the capabilities of LLMs. Previous research on exploiting multiple LoRAs either focuses on specific isolated downstream tasks or fixes the selection of LoRAs during training. However, in real-world scenarios, LLMs receive diverse prompts covering different tasks, and the pool of candidate LoRAs is often dynamically updated. To bridge this gap, we propose LoraRetriever, a retrieve-then-compose framework that adaptively retrieves and composes multiple LoRAs according to the input prompts. LoraRetriever contains three main components: firstly, identifying and retrieving LoRAs relevant to the given input; secondly, formulating strategies for effectively integrating the retrieved LoRAs; and thirdly, developing efficient batch inference to accommodate heterogeneous requests. Experimental results indicate that LoraRetriever consistently outperforms the baselines, highlighting its practical effectiveness and versatility.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated enhanced capabilities in function-calling, these advancements primarily rely on accessing the functions' responses. This methodology is practical for simpler APIs but faces scalability issues with irreversible APIs that significantly impact the system, such as a database deletion API. Similarly, processes requiring extensive time for each API call and those necessitating forward planning, like automated action pipelines, present complex challenges. Furthermore, scenarios often arise where a generalized approach is needed because algorithms lack direct access to the specific implementations of these functions or secrets to use them. Traditional tool planning methods are inadequate in these cases, compelling the need to operate within black-box environments. Unlike their performance in tool manipulation, LLMs excel in black-box tasks, such as program synthesis.
Therefore, we harness the program synthesis capabilities of LLMs to strategize tool usage in black-box settings, ensuring solutions are verified prior to implementation. We introduce TOPGUN, an ingeniously crafted approach leveraging program synthesis for black box tool planning. Accompanied by SwissNYF, a comprehensive suite that integrates black-box algorithms for planning and verification tasks, addressing the aforementioned challenges and enhancing the versatility and effectiveness of LLMs in complex API interactions. The public code for SwissNYF is available at https://github.com/iclr-dummy-user/SwissNYF.

Purpose: To assess the alignment of GPT-4-based evaluation to human clinician experts, for the evaluation of responses to ophthalmology-related patient queries generated by fine-tuned LLM chatbots. Methods: 400 ophthalmology questions and paired answers were created by ophthalmologists to represent commonly asked patient questions, divided into fine-tuning (368; 92%), and testing (40; 8%). We find-tuned 5 different LLMs, including LLAMA2-7b, LLAMA2-7b-Chat, LLAMA2-13b, and LLAMA2-13b-Chat. For the testing dataset, additional 8 glaucoma QnA pairs were included. 200 responses to the testing dataset were generated by 5 fine-tuned LLMs for evaluation. A customized clinical evaluation rubric was used to guide GPT-4 evaluation, grounded on clinical accuracy, relevance, patient safety, and ease of understanding. GPT-4 evaluation was then compared against ranking by 5 clinicians for clinical alignment. Results: Among all fine-tuned LLMs, GPT-3.5 scored the highest (87.1%), followed by LLAMA2-13b (80.9%), LLAMA2-13b-chat (75.5%), LLAMA2-7b-Chat (70%) and LLAMA2-7b (68.8%) based on the GPT-4 evaluation. GPT-4 evaluation demonstrated significant agreement with human clinician rankings, with Spearman and Kendall Tau correlation coefficients of 0.90 and 0.80 respectively; while correlation based on Cohen Kappa was more modest at 0.50.
Notably, qualitative analysis and the glaucoma sub-analysis revealed clinical inaccuracies in the LLM-generated responses, which were appropriately identified by the GPT-4 evaluation. Conclusion: The notable clinical alignment of GPT-4 evaluation highlighted its potential to streamline the clinical evaluation of LLM chatbot responses to healthcare-related queries. By complementing the existing clinician-dependent manual grading, this efficient and automated evaluation could assist the validation of future developments in LLM applications for healthcare.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-Modal Models (MMs) have demonstrated their remarkable capabilities in problem-solving. Yet, their proficiency in tackling geometry math problems, which necessitates an integrated understanding of both textual and visual information, has not been thoroughly evaluated. To address this gap, we introduce the GeoEval benchmark, a comprehensive collection that includes a main subset of 2000 problems, a 750 problem subset focusing on backward reasoning, an augmented subset of 2000 problems, and a hard subset of 300 problems. This benchmark facilitates a deeper investigation into the performance of LLMs and MMs on solving geometry math problems. Our evaluation of ten LLMs and MMs across these varied subsets reveals that the WizardMath model excels, achieving a 55.67\% accuracy rate on the main subset but only a 6.00\% accuracy on the challenging subset. This highlights the critical need for testing models against datasets on which they have not been pre-trained. Additionally, our findings indicate that GPT-series models perform more effectively on problems they have rephrased, suggesting a promising method for enhancing model capabilities.

Many diagnostic errors occur because clinicians cannot easily access relevant information in patient Electronic Health Records (EHRs). In this work we propose a method to use LLMs to identify pieces of evidence in patient EHR data that indicate increased or decreased risk of specific diagnoses; our ultimate aim is to increase access to evidence and reduce diagnostic errors. In particular, we propose a Neural Additive Model to make predictions backed by evidence with individualized risk estimates at time-points where clinicians are still uncertain, aiming to specifically mitigate delays in diagnosis and errors stemming from an incomplete differential. To train such a model, it is necessary to infer temporally fine-grained retrospective labels of eventual "true" diagnoses. We do so with LLMs, to ensure that the input text is from before a confident diagnosis can be made. We use an LLM to retrieve an initial pool of evidence, but then refine this set of evidence according to correlations learned by the model. We conduct an in-depth evaluation of the usefulness of our approach by simulating how it might be used by a clinician to decide between a pre-defined list of differential diagnoses.

Procedural content generation uses algorithmic techniques to create large amounts of new content for games at much lower production costs. In newer approaches, procedural content generation utilizes machine learning. However, these methods usually require expensive collection of large amounts of data, as well as the development and training of fairly complex learning models, which can be both extremely time-consuming and expensive. The core of our research is to explore whether we can lower the barrier to the use of personalized procedural content generation through a more practical and generalizable approach with large language models. Matching game content with player preferences benefits both players, who enjoy the game more, and developers, who increasingly depend on players enjoying the game before being able to monetize it. Therefore, this paper presents a novel approach to achieving personalization by using large language models to propose levels based on the gameplay data continuously collected from individual players. We compared the levels generated using our approach with levels generated with more traditional procedural generation techniques. Our easily reproducible method has proven viable in a production setting and outperformed levels generated by traditional methods in the probability that a player will not quit the game mid-level.

Optimization problems are pervasive in sectors from manufacturing and distribution to healthcare. However, most such problems are still solved heuristically by hand rather than optimally by state-of-the-art solvers because the expertise required to formulate and solve these problems limits the widespread adoption of optimization tools and techniques. This paper introduces OptiMUS, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent designed to formulate and solve (mixed integer) linear programming problems from their natural language descriptions. OptiMUS can develop mathematical models, write and debug solver code, evaluate the generated solutions, and improve its model and code based on these evaluations. OptiMUS utilizes a modular structure to process problems, allowing it to handle problems with long descriptions and complex data without long prompts. Experiments demonstrate that OptiMUS outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on easy datasets by more than $20\%$ and on hard datasets (including a new dataset, NLP4LP, released with this paper that features long and complex problems) by more than $30\%$.

There is increasing interest in using LLMs as decision-making "agents." Doing so includes many degrees of freedom: which model should be used; how should it be prompted; should it be asked to introspect, conduct chain-of-thought reasoning, etc? Settling these questions -- and more broadly, determining whether an LLM agent is reliable enough to be trusted -- requires a methodology for assessing such an agent's economic rationality. In this paper, we provide one. We begin by surveying the economic literature on rational decision making, taxonomizing a large set of fine-grained "elements" that an agent should exhibit, along with dependencies between them. We then propose a benchmark distribution that quantitatively scores an LLMs performance on these elements and, combined with a user-provided rubric, produces a "rationality report card." Finally, we describe the results of a large-scale empirical experiment with 14 different LLMs, characterizing the both current state of the art and the impact of different model sizes on models' ability to exhibit rational behavior.

This paper considers the challenges that Large Language Models (LLMs) face when reasoning over text that includes information involving uncertainty explicitly quantified via probability values. This type of reasoning is relevant to a variety of contexts ranging from everyday conversations to medical decision-making. Despite improvements in the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, they still exhibit significant difficulties when it comes to probabilistic reasoning. To deal with this problem, we first introduce the Bayesian Linguistic Inference Dataset (BLInD), a new dataset specifically designed to test the probabilistic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We then leverage this new dataset to thoroughly illustrate the specific limitations of LLMs for tasks involving probabilistic reasoning and present several strategies that map the problem to different formal representations, including Python code, probabilistic inference algorithms, and probabilistic logical programming. We conclude by providing an evaluation of our methods on BLInD and on an adaptation of a causal reasoning question-answering dataset, which further shows their practical effectiveness.

Through experiments, we demonstrate API Pack's efficacy in enhancing models for this specialized task while maintaining their overall proficiency at general coding. Fine-tuning CodeLlama-13B on just 20,000 Python instances yields over 10% and 5% higher accuracy than GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 respectively in generating unseen API calls. Scaling to 100k examples improves generalization to new APIs not seen during training. In addition, cross-lingual API call generation is achieved without needing extensive data per language.

This work aims to build a text embedder that can capture characteristics of texts specified by user instructions. Despite its tremendous potential to deploy user-oriented embeddings, none of previous approaches provides a concrete solution for it. This paper offers a new viewpoint, which treats the instruction as a question about the input text and encodes the expected answers to obtain the representation accordingly. Intuitively, texts with the same (implicit) semantics would share similar answers following the instruction, thus leading to more similar embeddings. Specifically, we propose InBedder that instantiates this embed-via-answering idea by only fine-tuning language models on abstractive question answering tasks. InBedder demonstrates significantly improved instruction-following capabilities according to our proposed instruction awareness tests and instruction robustness tests, when applied to both large language models (LLMs) (e.g., llama-2-7b) and smaller encoder-based LMs (e.g., roberta-large). Additionally, our qualitative analysis of clustering outcomes, achieved by applying different instructions to the same corpus, demonstrates a high degree of interpretability.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have surged in popularity in recent months, but they have demonstrated concerning capabilities to generate harmful content when manipulated. While techniques like safety fine-tuning aim to minimize harmful use, recent works have shown that LLMs remain vulnerable to attacks that elicit toxic responses. In this work, we introduce the Proxy-Guided Attack on LLMs (PAL), the first optimization-based attack on LLMs in a black-box query-only setting. In particular, it relies on a surrogate model to guide the optimization and a sophisticated loss designed for real-world LLM APIs. Our attack achieves 84% attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-3.5-Turbo and 48% on Llama-2-7B, compared to 4% for the current state of the art. We also propose GCG++, an improvement to the GCG attack that reaches 94% ASR on white-box Llama-2-7B, and the Random-Search Attack on LLMs (RAL), a strong but simple baseline for query-based attacks. We believe the techniques proposed in this work will enable more comprehensive safety testing of LLMs and, in the long term, the development of better security guardrails.

To address these limitations, we propose ReadAgent, an LLM agent system that increases effective context length up to 20x in our experiments. Inspired by how humans interactively read long documents, we implement ReadAgent as a simple prompting system that uses the advanced language capabilities of LLMs to (1) decide what content to store together in a memory episode, (2) compress those memory episodes into short episodic memories called gist memories, and (3) take actions to look up passages in the original text if ReadAgent needs to remind itself of relevant details to complete a task. We evaluate ReadAgent against baselines using retrieval methods, using the original long contexts, and using the gist memories. These evaluations are performed on three long-document reading comprehension tasks: QuALITY, NarrativeQA, and QMSum.
ReadAgent outperforms the baselines on all three tasks while extending the effective context window by 3-20x.

Large Language Models (LLMs) can make up answers that are not real, and this is known as hallucination. This research aims to see if, how, and to what extent LLMs are aware of hallucination. More specifically, we check whether and how an LLM reacts differently in its hidden states when it answers a question right versus when it hallucinates. To do this, we introduce an experimental framework which allows examining LLM's hidden states in different hallucination situations. Building upon this framework, we conduct a series of experiments with language models in the LLaMA family (Touvron et al., 2023). Our empirical findings suggest that LLMs react differently when processing a genuine response versus a fabricated one. We then apply various model interpretation techniques to help understand and explain the findings better. Moreover, informed by the empirical observations, we show great potential of using the guidance derived from LLM's hidden representation space to mitigate hallucination. We believe this work provides insights into how LLMs produce hallucinated answers and how to make them occur less often.

Selecting high-quality pre-training data is important for creating capable language models, but existing methods rely on simple heuristics. We introduce QuRating, a method for selecting pre-training data that captures the abstract qualities of texts which humans intuitively perceive. In this paper, we investigate four qualities - writing style, required expertise, facts & trivia, and educational value. We find that LLMs are able to discern these qualities and observe that they are better at making pairwise judgments of texts than at rating the quality of a text directly. We train a QuRater model to learn scalar ratings from pairwise judgments, and use it to annotate a 260B training corpus with quality ratings for each of the four criteria. In our experiments, we select 30B tokens according to the different quality ratings and train 1.3B-parameter language models on the selected data. We find that it is important to balance quality and diversity, as selecting only the highest-rated documents leads to poor results. When we sample using quality ratings as logits over documents, our models achieve lower perplexity and stronger in-context learning performance than baselines. Beyond data selection, we use the quality ratings to construct a training curriculum which improves performance without changing the training dataset. We extensively analyze the quality ratings and discuss their characteristics, biases, and wider implications.

The incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare marks a significant advancement. However, the application has predominantly been limited to discriminative and question-answering tasks, which does not fully leverage their interactive potential. To address this limitation, our paper presents AI Hospital, a framework designed to build a real-time interactive diagnosis environment. To simulate the procedure, we collect high-quality medical records to create patient, examiner, and medical director agents. AI Hospital is then utilized for the interactive evaluation and collaboration of LLMs. Initially, we create a Multi-View Medical Evaluation (MVME) benchmark where various LLMs serve as intern doctors for interactive diagnosis.
Subsequently, to improve diagnostic accuracy, we introduce a collaborative mechanism that involves iterative discussions and a dispute resolution process under the supervision of the medical director. In our experiments, we validate the reliability of AI Hospital. The results not only explore the feasibility of apply LLMs in clinical consultation but also confirm the effectiveness of the dispute resolution focused collaboration method.

Transformer based large language models have achieved tremendous success.
However, the significant memory and computational costs incurred during the inference process make it challenging to deploy large models on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we investigate compression and efficient inference methods for large language models from an algorithmic perspective. Regarding taxonomy, similar to smaller models, compression and acceleration algorithms for large language models can still be categorized into quantization, pruning, distillation, compact architecture design, dynamic networks. However, Large language models have two prominent characteristics compared to smaller models: (1) Most of compression algorithms require finetuning or even retraining the model after compression. The most notable aspect of large models is the very high cost associated with model finetuning or training. Therefore, many algorithms for large models, such as quantization and pruning, start to explore tuning-free algorithms. (2) Large models emphasize versatility and generalization rather than performance on a single task. Hence, many algorithms, such as knowledge distillation, focus on how to preserving their versatility and generalization after compression. Since these two characteristics were not very pronounced in early large models, we further distinguish large language models into medium models and ``real'' large models.
Additionally, we also provide an introduction to some mature frameworks for efficient inference of large models, which can support basic compression or acceleration algorithms, greatly facilitating model deployment for users.

This study explores the potential of fine-tuning foundational English Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating Polish text. The first step involves Language Adaptive Pre-training (LAPT) on a high-quality dataset of 3.11 GB, consisting of 276 million Polish tokens. The LAPT is followed by additional fine-tuning aimed at solving nine KLEJ challenges. Our trained model Curie-7B-v1 not only generates Polish text with the lowest perplexity of 3.02 among decoder-based Polish models but also closely rivals the performance of the best Polish encoder-decoder models with a less than 2% gap on 8 out of 9 tasks. Curie-7B-v1 used approximately 2-3% of a typical dataset size to learn Polish. The LAPT was completed in less than five days using a consumer GPU, highlighting the method's efficiency. The proficiency of the model in Polish was significantly enhanced, demonstrating the viability of this approach for adding new languages to existing LLMs by training just 1.2% of its parameters.
To contribute to the community's collaborative progress, the model has been released as open-source.

The considerable size of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents notable deployment challenges, particularly on resource-constrained hardware.
Structured pruning, offers an effective means to compress LLMs, thereby reducing storage costs and enhancing inference speed for more efficient utilization. In this work, we study data-efficient and resource-efficient structure pruning methods to obtain smaller yet still powerful models.
Knowledge Distillation is well-suited for pruning, as the intact model can serve as an excellent teacher for pruned students. However, it becomes challenging in the context of LLMs due to memory constraints. To address this, we propose an efficient progressive Numerous-teacher pruning method (NutePrune). NutePrune mitigates excessive memory costs by loading only one intact model and integrating it with various masks and LoRA modules, enabling it to seamlessly switch between teacher and student roles. This approach allows us to leverage numerous teachers with varying capacities to progressively guide the pruned model, enhancing overall performance. Extensive experiments across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of NutePrune. In LLaMA-7B zero-shot experiments, NutePrune retains 97.17% of the performance of the original model at 20% sparsity and 95.07% at 25% sparsity.

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing attention in the past few years, but they may still generate descriptions that include objects not present in the corresponding images, a phenomenon known as object hallucination. To eliminate hallucinations, existing methods manually annotate paired responses with and without hallucinations, and then employ various alignment algorithms to improve the alignment capability between images and text. However, they not only demand considerable computation resources during the finetuning stage but also require expensive human annotation to construct paired data needed by the alignment algorithms. To address these issues, we borrow the idea of unlearning and propose an efficient fine-grained unlearning framework (EFUF), which can eliminate hallucinations without the need for paired data. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently reduces hallucinations while preserving the generation quality with modest computational overhead. Our code and datasets will be publicly available.

Recent advances in training large language models (LLMs) using massive amounts of solely textual data lead to strong generalization across many domains and tasks, including document-specific tasks. Opposed to that there is a trend to train multi-modal transformer architectures tailored for document understanding that are designed specifically to fuse textual inputs with the corresponding document layout. This involves a separate fine-tuning step for which additional training data is required. At present, no document transformers with comparable generalization to LLMs are available That raises the question which type of model is to be preferred for document understanding tasks. In this paper we investigate the possibility to use purely text-based LLMs for document-specific tasks by using layout enrichment. We explore drop-in modifications and rule-based methods to enrich purely textual LLM prompts with layout information. In our experiments we investigate the effects on the commercial ChatGPT model and the open-source LLM Solar. We demonstrate that using our approach both LLMs show improved performance on various standard document benchmarks. In addition, we study the impact of noisy OCR and layout errors, as well as the limitations of LLMs when it comes to utilizing document layout. Our results indicate that layout enrichment can improve the performance of purely text-based LLMs for document understanding by up to 15% compared to just using plain document text. In conclusion, this approach should be considered for the best model choice between text-based LLM or multi-modal document transformers.

All text-based language problems can be reduced to either generation or embedding. Current models only perform well at one or the other. We introduce generative representational instruction tuning (GRIT) whereby a large language model is trained to handle both generative and embedding tasks by distinguishing between them through instructions. Compared to other open models, our resulting GritLM 7B sets a new state of the art on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and outperforms all models up to its size on a range of generative tasks. By scaling up further, GritLM 8x7B outperforms all open generative language models that we tried while still being among the best embedding models. Notably, we find that GRIT matches training on only generative or embedding data, thus we can unify both at no performance loss.
Among other benefits, the unification via GRIT speeds up Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by > 60% for long documents, by no longer requiring separate retrieval and generation models. Models, code, etc. are freely available at https://github.com/ContextualAI/gritlm.

How can we detect if copyrighted content was used in the training process of a language model, considering that the training data is typically undisclosed? We are motivated by the premise that a language model is likely to identify verbatim excerpts from its training text. We propose DE-COP, a method to determine whether a piece of copyrighted content was included in training.
DE-COP's core approach is to probe an LLM with multiple-choice questions, whose options include both verbatim text and their paraphrases. We construct BookTection, a benchmark with excerpts from 165 books published prior and subsequent to a model's training cutoff, along with their paraphrases. Our experiments show that DE-COP surpasses the prior best method by 9.6% in detection performance (AUC) on models with logits available. Moreover, DE-COP also achieves an average accuracy of 72% for detecting suspect books on fully black-box models where prior methods give $\approx$ 4% accuracy.

Mitigating the hallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) and enhancing them is a crucial task. Although some existing methods employ model self-enhancement techniques, they fall short of effectively addressing unknown factual hallucinations. Using Knowledge Graph (KG) enhancement approaches fails to address the generalization across different KG sources and the enhancement of open-ended answer questions simultaneously. To tackle these limitations, there is a framework that combines Pseudo-Graph Generation and Atomic Knowledge Verification proposed. The enhancement of LLM using KG in an open-ended question-answering setting is implemented by leveraging the Pseudo-Graph Generation. Atomic Knowledge Verification utilizes atomic-level knowledge querying and verification to achieve generalizability under different KG sources. Compared to the baseline, this approach yields a minimum improvement of 11.5 in the ROUGE-L score for open-ended questions. For precise questions, we observe a minimum accuracy improvement of 7.5. Moreover, there is also demonstration that this framework exhibits generalizability across different KG sources. In summary, our results pave the way for enhancing LLMs by incorporating Pseudo- and Multisource-KGs, particularly in the context of open-ended questions.

Large Language Models have proven highly successful at modelling a variety of tasks. However, this comes at a steep computational cost that hinders wider industrial uptake. In this pa005 per, we present MWT: a Multi-Word Tokenizer that goes beyond word boundaries by representing frequent multi-word expressions as single tokens. MWTs produce a more compact and efficient tokenization that yields two benefits: (1) Increase in performance due to a greater coverage of input data given a fixed sequence length and budget; (2) Faster and lighter inference due to the ability to reduce the sequence length with negligible drops in performance. Our results show that MWT is more robust across shorter sequence lengths, thus allowing for major speedups via early sequence truncation.

Previous in-context learning (ICL) research has focused on tasks such as classification, machine translation, text2table, etc., while studies on whether ICL can improve human-like dialogue generation are scarce. Our work fills this gap by systematically investigating the ICL capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in persona-based dialogue generation, conducting extensive experiments on high-quality real human Chinese dialogue datasets. From experimental results, we draw three conclusions: 1) adjusting prompt instructions is the most direct, effective, and economical way to improve generation quality; 2) randomly retrieving demonstrations (demos) achieves the best results, possibly due to the greater diversity and the amount of effective information; counter-intuitively, retrieving demos with a context identical to the query performs the worst; 3) even when we destroy the multi-turn associations and single-turn semantics in the demos, increasing the number of demos still improves dialogue performance, proving that LLMs can learn from corrupted dialogue demos. Previous explanations of the ICL mechanism, such as $n$-gram induction head, cannot fully account for this phenomenon.

Recent work has shown that, while large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong word translation or bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) capabilities in few-shot setups, they still cannot match the performance of 'traditional' mapping-based approaches in the unsupervised scenario where no seed translation pairs are available, especially for lower-resource languages. To address this challenge with LLMs, we propose self-augmented in-context learning (SAIL) for unsupervised BLI: starting from a zero-shot prompt, SAIL iteratively induces a set of high-confidence word translation pairs for in-context learning (ICL) from an LLM, which it then reapplies to the same LLM in the ICL fashion. Our method shows substantial gains over zero-shot prompting of LLMs on two established BLI benchmarks spanning a wide range of language pairs, also outperforming mapping-based baselines across the board. In addition to achieving state-of-the-art unsupervised BLI performance, we also conduct comprehensive analyses on SAIL and discuss its limitations.

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been extensively employed to align large language models with user intent. However, proximal policy optimization (PPO) based RLHF is occasionally unstable requiring significant hyperparameter finetuning, and computationally expensive to maximize the estimated reward during alignment. Recently, direct preference optimization (DPO) is proposed to address those challenges. However, DPO relies on contrastive responses generated from human annotator and alternative LLM, instead of the policy model, limiting the effectiveness of the RLHF. In this paper, we addresses both challenges by systematically combining rejection sampling (RS) and DPO. Our proposed method, RS-DPO, initiates with the development of a supervised fine-tuned policy model (SFT). A varied set of k responses per prompt are sampled directly from the SFT model. RS-DPO identifies pairs of contrastive samples based on their reward distribution. Finally, we apply DPO with the contrastive samples to align the model to human preference.
Our experiments indicate that our proposed method effectively fine-tunes LLMs with limited resource environments, leading to improved alignment with user intent. Furthermore, it outperforms existing methods, including RS, PPO, and DPO.

While displaying impressive generation capabilities across many tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with crucial issues of privacy violation and unwanted exposure of sensitive data. This raises an essential question: how should we prevent such undesired behavior of LLMs while maintaining their strong generation and natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities? In this work, we introduce a novel approach termed deliberate imagination in the context of LLM unlearning. Instead of trying to forget memorized data, we employ a self-distillation framework, guiding LLMs to deliberately imagine alternative scenarios. As demonstrated in a wide range of experiments, the proposed method not only effectively unlearns targeted text but also preserves the LLMs' capabilities in open-ended generation tasks as well as in NLU tasks.
Our results demonstrate the usefulness of this approach across different models and sizes, and also with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, offering a novel pathway to addressing the challenges with private and sensitive data in LLM applications.

The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated their vast potential across various domains, attributed to their extensive pretraining knowledge and exceptional generalizability. However, LLMs often encounter challenges in generating harmful content when faced with problematic prompts. To address this problem, existing work attempted to implement a gradient ascent based approach to prevent LLMs from producing harmful output.
While these methods can be effective, they frequently impact the model utility in responding to normal prompts. To address this gap, we introduce Selective Knowledge negation Unlearning (SKU), a novel unlearning framework for LLMs, designed to eliminate harmful knowledge while preserving utility on normal prompts. Specifically, SKU is consisted of two stages: harmful knowledge acquisition stage and knowledge negation stage. The first stage aims to identify and acquire harmful knowledge within the model, whereas the second is dedicated to remove this knowledge. SKU selectively isolates and removes harmful knowledge in model parameters, ensuring the model's performance remains robust on normal prompts. Our experiments conducted across various LLM architectures demonstrate that SKU identifies a good balance point between removing harmful information and preserving utility.

Emotional Intelligence (EI), consisting of emotion perception, emotion cognition and emotion expression, plays the critical roles in improving user interaction experience for the current large language model (LLM) based conversational general AI assistants. Previous works mainly focus on raising the emotion perception ability of them via naive fine-tuning on EI-related classification or regression tasks. However, this leads to the incomplete enhancement of EI and catastrophic forgetting of the general intelligence (GI).
To this end, we first introduce \textsc{EiBench}, a large-scale collection of EI-related tasks in the text-to-text formation with task instructions that covers all three aspects of EI, which lays a solid foundation for the comprehensive EI enhancement of LLMs. Then a novel \underline{\textbf{Mo}}dular \underline{\textbf{E}}motional \underline{\textbf{I}}ntelligence enhancement method (\textbf{MoEI}), consisting of Modular Parameter Expansion and intra-inter modulation, is proposed to comprehensively enhance the EI of LLMs without compromise their GI. Extensive experiments on two representative LLM-based assistants, Flan-T5 and LLaMA-2-Chat, demonstrate the effectiveness of MoEI to improving EI while maintain GI.

Instruction tuning is critical to large language models (LLMs) for achieving better instruction following and task adaptation capabilities but its success heavily relies on the training data quality. Many recent methods focus on improving the data quality but often overlook the compatibility of the data with the student model being finetuned. This paper introduces Selective Reflection-Tuning, a novel paradigm that synergizes a teacher LLM's reflection and introspection for improving existing data quality with the data selection capability of the student LLM, to automatically refine existing instruction-tuning data. This teacher-student collaboration produces high-quality and student-compatible instruction-response pairs, resulting in sample-efficient instruction tuning and LLMs of superior performance. Selective Reflection-Tuning is a data augmentation and synthesis that generally improves LLM finetuning and self-improvement without collecting brand-new data. We apply our method to Alpaca and WizardLM data and achieve much stronger and top-tier 7B and 13B LLMs. Our codes, models, and data will be released at https://github.com/tianyi-lab/Reflection_Tuning.

In light of recent advances in large language models~(LLMs), the expectations for the next generation of virtual assistants include enhanced naturalness and adaptability across diverse usage scenarios. However, the creation of high-quality annotated data for Task-Oriented Dialog~(TOD) is recognized to be slow and costly. To address these challenges, we introduce Task-Oriented Automatic Dialogs~(TOAD), a novel and scalable TOD dataset along with its automatic generation pipeline. The TOAD dataset simulates realistic app context interaction and provide a variety of system response style options. Two aspects of system response styles are considered, verbosity level and users' expression mirroring. We benchmark TOAD on two response generation tasks and the results show that modeling more verbose or responses without user expression mirroring is more challenging.

As language models continue to scale in size and capability, they display an array of emerging behaviors, both beneficial and concerning. This heightens the need to control model behaviors. We hope to be able to control the personality traits of language models at the inference-time so as to have various character features, on top of which the requirements of different types of tasks can be met. Personality is a higher-level and more abstract behavioral representation for language models. We introduce ControlLM, which leverages differential activation patterns, derived from contrasting behavioral prompts in the model's latent space, to influence the model's personality traits at inference. This approach allows for the precise, real-time adjustment of model behavior. First, we demonstrate ControlLM's capacity to elicit diverse persona behaviors without any training, while precision control allows personality traits to closely match average human values. Subsequently, we showcase improved reasoning and question answering through selective amplification of beneficial attributes like conscientiousness and friendliness. We hope that this work will inspire research on controlling human-like behaviors of language models and provide insights for future research.

Effective diabetes management is crucial for maintaining health in diabetic patients. Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for diabetes management, facilitating their efficacy. However, current LLM-based approaches are limited by their dependence on general sources and lack of integration with domain-specific knowledge, leading to inaccurate responses. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-infused LLM-powered conversational health agent (CHA) for diabetic patients. We customize and leverage the open-source openCHA framework, enhancing our CHA with external knowledge and analytical capabilities. This integration involves two key components: 1) incorporating the American Diabetes Association dietary guidelines and the Nutritionix information and 2) deploying analytical tools that enable nutritional intake calculation and comparison with the guidelines. We compare the proposed CHA with GPT4. Our evaluation includes 100 diabetes-related questions on daily meal choices and assessing the potential risks associated with the suggested diet. Our findings show that the proposed agent demonstrates superior performance in generating responses to manage essential nutrients.

Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in aligning generated text with user intentions across various tasks. When it comes to long-form text generation, there has been a growing interest in generation from a discourse coherence perspective. However, existing lexical or semantic metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, BertScore cannot effectively capture the discourse coherence. The development of discourse-specific automatic evaluation methods for assessing the output of LLMs warrants greater focus and exploration. In this paper, we present a novel automatic metric designed to quantify the discourse divergence between two long-form articles. Extensive experiments on three datasets from representative domains demonstrate that our metric aligns more closely with human preferences and GPT-4 coherence evaluation, outperforming existing evaluation methods.

Recent work has shown the immense potential of synthetically generated datasets for training large language models (LLMs), especially for acquiring targeted skills. Current large-scale math instruction tuning datasets such as MetaMathQA (Yu et al., 2024) and MAmmoTH (Yue et al., 2024) are constructed using outputs from closed-source LLMs with commercially restrictive licenses. A key reason limiting the use of open-source LLMs in these data generation pipelines has been the wide gap between the mathematical skills of the best closed-source LLMs, such as GPT-4, and the best open-source LLMs. Building on the recent progress in open-source LLMs, our proposed prompting novelty, and some brute-force scaling, we construct OpenMathInstruct-1, a math instruction tuning dataset with 1.8M problem-solution pairs. The dataset is constructed by synthesizing code-interpreter solutions for GSM8K and MATH, two popular math reasoning benchmarks, using the recently released and permissively licensed Mixtral model. Our best model, OpenMath-CodeLlama-70B, trained on a subset of OpenMathInstruct-1, achieves a score of 84.6% on GSM8K and 50.7% on MATH, which is competitive with the best gpt-distilled models. We release our code, models, and the OpenMathInstruct-1 dataset under a commercially permissive license.

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has inspired the development of LLM-based agents capable of addressing complex, real-world tasks. However, these agents often struggle during task execution due to methodological constraints, such as error propagation and limited adaptability.
To address this issue, we propose a multi-agent framework based on dynamic Task Decomposition and Agent Generation (TDAG). This framework dynamically decomposes complex tasks into smaller subtasks and assigns each to a specifically generated subagent, thereby enhancing adaptability in diverse and unpredictable real-world tasks. Simultaneously, existing benchmarks often lack the granularity needed to evaluate incremental progress in complex, multi-step tasks. In response, we introduce ItineraryBench in the context of travel planning, featuring interconnected, progressively complex tasks with a fine-grained evaluation system. ItineraryBench is designed to assess agents' abilities in memory, planning, and tool usage across tasks of varying complexity. Our experimental results reveal that TDAG significantly outperforms established baselines, showcasing its superior adaptability and context awareness in complex task scenarios.

In-context learning has emerged as a groundbreaking ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and revolutionized various fields by providing a few task-relevant demonstrations in the prompt. However, trustworthy issues with LLM's response, such as hallucination, have also been actively discussed.
Existing works have been devoted to quantifying the uncertainty in LLM's response, but they often overlook the complex nature of LLMs and the uniqueness of in-context learning. In this work, we delve into the predictive uncertainty of LLMs associated with in-context learning, highlighting that such uncertainties may stem from both the provided demonstrations (aleatoric uncertainty) and ambiguities tied to the model's configurations (epistemic uncertainty). We propose a novel formulation and corresponding estimation method to quantify both types of uncertainties. The proposed method offers an unsupervised way to understand the prediction of in-context learning in a plug-and-play fashion. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the decomposition. The code and data are available at: \url{https://github.com/lingchen0331/UQ_ICL}.

Language agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have seen exploding development. Their capability of using language as a vehicle for thought and communication lends an incredible level of flexibility and versatility. People have quickly capitalized on this capability to connect LLMs to a wide range of external components and environments: databases, tools, the Internet, robotic embodiment, etc. Many believe an unprecedentedly powerful automation technology is emerging. However, new automation technologies come with new safety risks, especially for intricate systems like language agents. There is a surprisingly large gap between the speed and scale of their development and deployment and our understanding of their safety risks. Are we building a house of cards? In this position paper, we present the first systematic effort in mapping adversarial attacks against language agents. We first present a unified conceptual framework for agents with three major components: Perception, Brain, and Action. Under this framework, we present a comprehensive discussion and propose 12 potential attack scenarios against different components of an agent, covering different attack strategies (e.g., input manipulation, adversarial demonstrations, jailbreaking, backdoors). We also draw connections to successful attack strategies previously applied to LLMs. We emphasize the urgency to gain a thorough understanding of language agent risks before their widespread deployment.

In enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), prior research primarily focuses on specific prompting techniques such as few-shot or zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. These methods, while effective, often involve manually intensive prompt engineering. Our study takes a novel approach by asking: Can LLMs reason effectively without prompting? Our findings reveal that, intriguingly, CoT reasoning paths can be elicited from pre-trained LLMs by simply altering the \textit{decoding} process. Rather than conventional greedy decoding, we investigate the top-$k$ alternative tokens, uncovering that CoT paths are frequently inherent in these sequences. This approach not only bypasses the confounders of prompting but also allows us to assess the LLMs' \textit{intrinsic} reasoning abilities. Moreover, we observe that the presence of a CoT in the decoding path correlates with a higher confidence in the model's decoded answer. This confidence metric effectively differentiates between CoT and non-CoT paths. Extensive empirical studies on various reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed CoT-decoding substantially outperforms the standard greedy decoding.

In the evolving landscape of machine learning, a pivotal challenge lies in deciphering the internal representations harnessed by neural networks and Transformers. Building on recent progress toward comprehending how networks execute distinct target functions, our study embarks on an exploration of the underlying reasons behind networks adopting specific computational strategies.
We direct our focus to the complex algebraic learning task of modular addition involving $k$ inputs. Our research presents a thorough analytical characterization of the features learned by stylized one-hidden layer neural networks and one-layer Transformers in addressing this task.
A cornerstone of our theoretical framework is the elucidation of how the principle of margin maximization shapes the features adopted by one-hidden layer neural networks. Let $p$ denote the modulus, $D_p$ denote the dataset of modular arithmetic with $k$ inputs and $m$ denote the network width. We demonstrate that a neuron count of $ m \geq 2^{2k-2} \cdot (p-1) $, these networks attain a maximum $ L_{2,k+1} $-margin on the dataset $ D_p $.
Furthermore, we establish that each hidden-layer neuron aligns with a specific Fourier spectrum, integral to solving modular addition problems.
By correlating our findings with the empirical observations of similar studies, we contribute to a deeper comprehension of the intrinsic computational mechanisms of neural networks. Furthermore, we observe similar computational mechanisms in the attention matrix of the Transformer. This research stands as a significant stride in unraveling their operation complexities, particularly in the realm of complex algebraic tasks.

The training of large language models (LLMs) is expensive. In this paper, we study data-efficient approaches for pre-training LLMs, i.e., techniques that aim to optimize the Pareto frontier of model quality and training resource/data consumption. We seek to understand the tradeoffs associated with data selection routines based on (i) expensive-to-compute data-quality estimates, and (ii) maximization of coverage and diversity-based measures in the feature space. Our first technique, Ask-LLM, leverages the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs to directly assess the quality of a training example. To target coverage, we propose Density sampling, which models the data distribution to select a diverse sample. In our comparison of 19 samplers, involving hundreds of evaluation tasks and pre-training runs, we find that Ask-LLM and Density are the best methods in their respective categories.
Coverage sampling can recover the performance of the full data, while models trained on Ask-LLM data consistently outperform full-data training -- even when we reject 90% of the original dataset, while converging up to 70% faster.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the fields of computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). One of the most notable advancements of LLMs is that a single model is trained on vast and diverse datasets spanning multiple domains -- a paradigm we term `All in One'. This methodology empowers LLMs with super generalization capabilities, facilitating an encompassing comprehension of varied data distributions. Leveraging these capabilities, a single LLM demonstrates remarkable versatility across a variety of domains -- a paradigm we term `One for All'. However, applying this idea to the graph field remains a formidable challenge, with cross-domain pretraining often resulting in negative transfer. This issue is particularly important in few-shot learning scenarios, where the paucity of training data necessitates the incorporation of external knowledge sources. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel approach called Graph COordinators for PrEtraining (GCOPE), that harnesses the underlying commonalities across diverse graph datasets to enhance few-shot learning. Our novel methodology involves a unification framework that amalgamates disparate graph datasets during the pretraining phase to distill and transfer meaningful knowledge to target tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple graph datasets demonstrate the superior efficacy of our approach. By successfully leveraging the synergistic potential of multiple graph datasets for pretraining, our work stands as a pioneering contribution to the realm of graph foundational model.

We study the robustness of deep reinforcement learning algorithms against distribution shifts within contextual multi-stage stochastic combinatorial optimization problems from the operations research domain. In this context, risk-sensitive algorithms promise to learn robust policies. While this field is of general interest to the reinforcement learning community, most studies up-to-date focus on theoretical results rather than real-world performance.
With this work, we aim to bridge this gap by formally deriving a novel risk-sensitive deep reinforcement learning algorithm while providing numerical evidence for its efficacy. Specifically, we introduce discrete Soft Actor-Critic for the entropic risk measure by deriving a version of the Bellman equation for the respective Q-values. We establish a corresponding policy improvement result and infer a practical algorithm. We introduce an environment that represents typical contextual multi-stage stochastic combinatorial optimization problems and perform numerical experiments to empirically validate our algorithm's robustness against realistic distribution shifts, without compromising performance on the training distribution. We show that our algorithm is superior to risk-neutral Soft Actor-Critic as well as to two benchmark approaches for robust deep reinforcement learning. Thereby, we provide the first structured analysis on the robustness of reinforcement learning under distribution shifts in the realm of contextual multi-stage stochastic combinatorial optimization problems.

There is a trilemma in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF): the incompatibility between highly diverse contexts, low labeling cost, and reliable alignment performance. Here we aim to mitigate such incompatibility through the design of dataset information structures during reward modeling.
Specifically, we first reexamine the RLHF process and propose a theoretical framework portraying it as an autoencoding process over text distributions. Our framework formalizes the RLHF objective of ensuring distributional consistency between human preference and large language model (LLM) behavior. Building on this framework, we then systematically investigate the performance impact of information structure in the reward modeling stage of RLHF. To further understand reward generalization in the reward modeling stage, we introduce a new method based on random graph theory that models generalization in the semantic space. A key insight of our analysis is the superiority of the tree-based information structure in reward modeling, compared to chain-based baselines adopted by conventional RLHF methods. We derive that under highly complex contexts with limited data, the tree-based reward model (RM) induces up to $\Theta(\log n/\log\log n)$ times less variance than chain-based RM where $n$ is the dataset size. To validate our theoretical contribution, we demonstrate that on three different NLP tasks, the tree-based RM achieves 65% win rate on average against chain-based baselines. Looking forward, we hope our framework can serve as a step towards understanding goal misgeneralization.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained in two phases: pre-training on large internet-scale datasets, and fine-tuning for downstream tasks. Given the higher computational demand of pre-training, it's intuitive to assume that fine-tuning adds less new information to the model, and is thus more compressible. We explore this assumption by decomposing the weights of fine-tuned models into their pre-trained components and an additional delta. We introduce a simple method, BitDelta, which successfully quantizes this delta down to 1 bit without compromising performance. This interesting finding not only highlights the potential redundancy of information added during fine-tuning, but also has significant implications for the multi-tenant serving and multi-tenant storage of fine-tuned models. By enabling the use of a single high-precision base model accompanied by multiple 1-bit deltas, BitDelta dramatically reduces GPU memory requirements by more than 10x, which can also be translated to enhanced generation latency in multi-tenant settings. We validate BitDelta through experiments across Llama-2 and Mistral model families, and on models up to 70B parameters, showcasing minimal performance degradation over all tested settings.

We consider the problem of multi-objective alignment of foundation models with human preferences, which is a critical step towards helpful and harmless AI systems. However, it is generally costly and unstable to fine-tune large foundation models using reinforcement learning (RL), and the multi-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and conflicting nature of human preferences further complicate the alignment process. In this paper, we introduce Rewards-in-Context (RiC), which conditions the response of a foundation model on multiple rewards in its prompt context and applies supervised fine-tuning for alignment. The salient features of RiC are simplicity and adaptivity, as it only requires supervised fine-tuning of a single foundation model and supports dynamic adjustment for user preferences during inference time. Inspired by the analytical solution of an abstracted convex optimization problem, our dynamic inference-time adjustment method approaches the Pareto-optimal solution for multiple objectives. Empirical evidence demonstrates the efficacy of our method in aligning both Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models to accommodate diverse rewards with only around $10\%$ GPU hours compared with multi-objective RL baseline.

Fine-tuning Diffusion Models remains an underexplored frontier in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), especially when compared with the remarkable progress made in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). While cutting-edge diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion (SD) and SDXL rely on supervised fine-tuning, their performance inevitably plateaus after seeing a certain volume of data. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been employed to fine-tune diffusion models with human preference data, but it requires at least two images ("winner" and "loser" images) for each text prompt. In this paper, we introduce an innovative technique called self-play fine-tuning for diffusion models (SPIN-Diffusion), where the diffusion model engages in competition with its earlier versions, facilitating an iterative self-improvement process. Our approach offers an alternative to conventional supervised fine-tuning and RL strategies, significantly improving both model performance and alignment. Our experiments on the Pick-a-Pic dataset reveal that SPIN-Diffusion outperforms the existing supervised fine-tuning method in aspects of human preference alignment and visual appeal right from its first iteration. By the second iteration, it exceeds the performance of RLHF-based methods across all metrics, achieving these results with less data.

Controllable music generation plays a vital role in human-AI music co-creation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-quality music, their focus on autoregressive generation limits their utility in music editing tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method. This approach enables autoregressive language models to seamlessly address music inpainting tasks.
Additionally, our PEFT method integrates frame-level content-based controls, facilitating track-conditioned music refinement and score-conditioned music arrangement.

In the field of robotics and automation, navigation systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown impressive performance. However, the security aspects of these systems have received relatively less attention. This paper pioneers the exploration of vulnerabilities in LLM-based navigation models in urban outdoor environments, a critical area given the technology's widespread application in autonomous driving, logistics, and emergency services. Specifically, we introduce a novel Navigational Prompt Suffix (NPS) Attack that manipulates LLM-based navigation models by appending gradient-derived suffixes to the original navigational prompt, leading to incorrect actions. We conducted comprehensive experiments on an LLMs-based navigation model that employs various LLMs for reasoning. Our results, derived from the Touchdown and Map2Seq street-view datasets under both few-shot learning and fine-tuning configurations, demonstrate notable performance declines across three metrics in the face of both white-box and black-box attacks. These results highlight the generalizability and transferability of the NPS Attack, emphasizing the need for enhanced security in LLM-based navigation systems. As an initial countermeasure, we propose the Navigational Prompt Engineering (NPE) Defense strategy, concentrating on navigation-relevant keywords to reduce the impact of adversarial suffixes. While initial findings indicate that this strategy enhances navigational safety, there remains a critical need for the wider research community to develop stronger defense methods to effectively tackle the real-world challenges faced by these systems.

The rapid progression in artificial intelligence has facilitated the emergence of large language models like ChatGPT, offering potential applications extending into specialized engineering modeling, especially physics-based building energy modeling. This paper investigates the innovative integration of large language models with building energy modeling software, focusing specifically on the fusion of ChatGPT with EnergyPlus. A literature review is first conducted to reveal a growing trend of incorporating of large language models in engineering modeling, albeit limited research on their application in building energy modeling. We underscore the potential of large language models in addressing building energy modeling challenges and outline potential applications including 1) simulation input generation, 2) simulation output analysis and visualization, 3) conducting error analysis, 4) co-simulation, 5) simulation knowledge extraction and training, and 6) simulation optimization. Three case studies reveal the transformative potential of large language models in automating and optimizing building energy modeling tasks, underscoring the pivotal role of artificial intelligence in advancing sustainable building practices and energy efficiency. The case studies demonstrate that selecting the right large language model techniques is essential to enhance performance and reduce engineering efforts. Besides direct use of large language models, three specific techniques were utilized: 1) prompt engineering, 2) retrieval-augmented generation, and 3) multi-agent large language models. The findings advocate a multidisciplinary approach in future artificial intelligence research, with implications extending beyond building energy modeling to other specialized engineering modeling.

Protein research is crucial in various fundamental disciplines, but understanding their intricate structure-function relationships remains challenging. Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in comprehending task-specific knowledge, suggesting the potential for ChatGPT-like systems specialized in protein to facilitate basic research. In this work, we introduce ProtChatGPT, which aims at learning and understanding protein structures via natural languages. ProtChatGPT enables users to upload proteins, ask questions, and engage in interactive conversations to produce comprehensive answers. The system comprises protein encoders, a Protein-Language Pertaining Transformer (PLP-former), a projection adapter, and an LLM. The protein first undergoes protein encoders and PLP-former to produce protein embeddings, which are then projected by the adapter to conform with the LLM. The LLM finally combines user questions with projected embeddings to generate informative answers. Experiments show that ProtChatGPT can produce promising responses to proteins and their corresponding questions. We hope that ProtChatGPT could form the basis for further exploration and application in protein research. Code and our pre-trained model will be publicly available.

Solely relying on test passing to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for code synthesis may result in unfair assessment or promoting models with data leakage. As an alternative, we introduce CodeMind, a framework designed to gauge the code reasoning abilities of LLMs. CodeMind currently supports three code reasoning tasks: Independent Execution Reasoning (IER), Dependent Execution Reasoning (DER), and Specification Reasoning (SR). The first two evaluate models to predict the execution output of an arbitrary code or code the model could correctly synthesize. The third one evaluates the extent to which LLMs implement the specified expected behavior. Our extensive evaluation of nine LLMs across five benchmarks in two different programming languages using CodeMind shows that LLMs fairly understand control flow constructs and, in general, are capable of reasoning how inputs evolve to output, specifically for simple programs and the ones they can correctly synthesize. However, their performance drops for code with higher complexity, non-trivial logical and arithmetic operators, non-primitive types, and API calls. Furthermore, we observe that, while correlated, specification reasoning (essential for code synthesis) does not imply execution reasoning (essential for broader programming tasks such as testing and debugging): ranking LLMs based on test passing can be different compared to code reasoning.

The remarkable instruction-following capability of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in automatically learning suitable prompts. However, while many effective methods have been proposed, the cost incurred during the learning process (e.g., accessing LLM and evaluating the responses) has not been considered. To overcome this limitation, this work explicitly incorporates a finite budget constraint into prompt learning.
Towards developing principled solutions, a novel connection is established between prompt learning and fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI-FB) in multi-armed bandits (MAB). Based on this connection, a general framework TRIPLE (besT aRm Identification for Prompt LEarning) is proposed to harness the power of BAI-FB in prompt learning systematically. Unique characteristics of prompt learning further lead to two embedding-based enhancements of TRIPLE by exploiting the ideas of clustering and function approximation. Extensive experiments on multiple well-adopted tasks using both GPT 3.5 and Llama2 demonstrate the significant performance improvement of TRIPLE over the previous baselines while satisfying the limited budget constraints.

SMS phishing, also known as "smishing", is a growing threat that tricks users into disclosing private information or clicking into URLs with malicious content through fraudulent mobile text messages. In recent past, we have also observed a rapid advancement of conversational generative AI chatbot services (e.g., OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's BARD), which are powered by pre-trained large language models (LLMs). These AI chatbots certainly have a lot of utilities but it is not systematically understood how they can play a role in creating threats and attacks. In this paper, we propose AbuseGPT method to show how the existing generative AI-based chatbot services can be exploited by attackers in real world to create smishing texts and eventually lead to craftier smishing campaigns. To the best of our knowledge, there is no pre-existing work that evidently shows the impacts of these generative text-based models on creating SMS phishing. Thus, we believe this study is the first of its kind to shed light on this emerging cybersecurity threat. We have found strong empirical evidences to show that attackers can exploit ethical standards in the existing generative AI-based chatbot services by crafting prompt injection attacks to create newer smishing campaigns. We also discuss some future research directions and guidelines to protect the abuse of generative AI-based services and safeguard users from smishing attacks.

Recently, the potential of large language models (LLMs) has been widely used in assisting programming. However, current research does not explore the artist potential of LLMs in creative coding within artist and AI collaboration. Our work probes the reflection type of artists in the creation process with such collaboration. We compare two common collaboration approaches: invoking the entire program and multiple subtasks. Our findings exhibit artists' different stimulated reflections in two different methods. Our finding also shows the correlation of reflection type with user performance, user satisfaction, and subjective experience in two collaborations through conducting two methods, including experimental data and qualitative interviews. In this sense, our work reveals the artistic potential of LLM in creative coding. Meanwhile, we provide a critical lens of human-AI collaboration from the artists' perspective and expound design suggestions for future work of AI-assisted creative tasks.

The rapidly evolving multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) urgently require new benchmarks to uniformly evaluate their performance on understanding and textually describing music. However, due to semantic gaps between Music Information Retrieval (MIR) algorithms and human understanding, discrepancies between professionals and the public, and low precision of annotations, existing music description datasets cannot serve as benchmarks. To this end, we present MuChin, the first open-source music description benchmark in Chinese colloquial language, designed to evaluate the performance of multimodal LLMs in understanding and describing music. We established the Caichong Music Annotation Platform (CaiMAP) that employs an innovative multi-person, multi-stage assurance method, and recruited both amateurs and professionals to ensure the precision of annotations and alignment with popular semantics.
Utilizing this method, we built a dataset with multi-dimensional, high-precision music annotations, the Caichong Music Dataset (CaiMD), and carefully selected 1,000 high-quality entries to serve as the test set for MuChin. Based on MuChin, we analyzed the discrepancies between professionals and amateurs in terms of music description, and empirically demonstrated the effectiveness of annotated data for fine-tuning LLMs. Ultimately, we employed MuChin to evaluate existing music understanding models on their ability to provide colloquial descriptions of music. All data related to the benchmark and the code for scoring have been open-sourced.

Automated management requires decomposing high-level user requests, such as intents, to an abstraction that the system can understand and execute. This is challenging because even a simple intent requires performing a number of ordered steps. And the task of identifying and adapting these steps (as conditions change) requires a decomposition approach that cannot be exactly pre-defined beforehand. To tackle these challenges and support automated intent decomposition and execution, we explore the few-shot capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose a pipeline that progressively decomposes intents by generating the required actions using a policy-based abstraction.
This allows us to automate the policy execution by creating a closed control loop for the intent deployment. To do so, we generate and map the policies to APIs and form application management loops that perform the necessary monitoring, analysis, planning and execution. We evaluate our proposal with a use-case to fulfill and assure an application service chain of virtual network functions. Using our approach, we can generalize and generate the necessary steps to realize intents, thereby enabling intent automation for application management.

Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) is a nascent multimodal task that aims to identify named entities, entity types and their corresponding visual regions. GMNER task exhibits two challenging properties: 1) The weak correlation between image-text pairs in social media results in a significant portion of named entities being ungroundable. 2) There exists a distinction between coarse-grained referring expressions commonly used in similar tasks (e.g., phrase localization, referring expression comprehension) and fine-grained named entities. In this paper, we propose RiVEG, a unified framework that reformulates GMNER into a joint MNER-VE-VG task by leveraging large language models (LLMs) as a connecting bridge. This reformulation brings two benefits: 1) It maintains the optimal MNER performance and eliminates the need for employing object detection methods to pre-extract regional features, thereby naturally addressing two major limitations of existing GMNER methods.
2) The introduction of entity expansion expression and Visual Entailment (VE) Module unifies Visual Grounding (VG) and Entity Grounding (EG). It enables RiVEG to effortlessly inherit the Visual Entailment and Visual Grounding capabilities of any current or prospective multimodal pretraining models.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that RiVEG outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the existing GMNER dataset and achieves absolute leads of 10.65%, 6.21%, and 8.83% in all three subtasks.

The growing volume of digital images necessitates advanced systems for efficient categorization and retrieval, presenting a significant challenge in database management and information retrieval. This paper introduces PICS (Pipeline for Image Captioning and Search), a novel approach designed to address the complexities inherent in organizing large-scale image repositories.
PICS leverages the advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the process of image captioning, offering a solution that transcends traditional manual annotation methods. The approach is rooted in the understanding that meaningful, AI-generated captions can significantly enhance the searchability and accessibility of images in large databases. By integrating sentiment analysis into the pipeline, PICS further enriches the metadata, enabling nuanced searches that extend beyond basic descriptors. This methodology not only simplifies the task of managing vast image collections but also sets a new precedent for accuracy and efficiency in image retrieval. The significance of PICS lies in its potential to transform image database systems, harnessing the power of machine learning and natural language processing to meet the demands of modern digital asset management.

In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) has become the modern tool of choice for many natural language processing tasks. However, how the text style of in-context examples influences the performance of LLMs still remains under-explored. This paper presents a novel and effective approach, named \textbf{AlignedCoT}, to improve the reasoning capability of LLMs by aligning the in-context examples with the native style of LLMs. ``Native'' refers to the inherent characteristic of LLMs which can be probed by zero-shot scenarios. We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on several benchmarks on mathematical question-answering and common-sense reasoning. The empirical results demonstrate that our AlignedCoT significantly improves performance over the carefully handcrafted demonstrations. Specifically, with AlignedCoT, we observe an average +3.2\% improvement for \texttt{gpt-3.5-turbo} compared to the carefully handcrafted CoT on multi-step reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, we use AlignedCoT to rewrite the CoT text style in the training set, which improves the performance of Retrieval Augmented Generation by 3.6\%.

Theorem proving is a fundamental task in mathematics. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) and interactive theorem provers (ITPs) like Lean, there has been growing interest in integrating LLMs and ITPs to automate theorem proving. In this approach, the LLM generates proof steps (tactics), and the ITP checks the applicability of the tactics at the current goal. The two systems work together to complete the proof. In this paper, we introduce DS-Prover, a novel dynamic sampling method for theorem proving. This method dynamically determines the number of tactics to apply to expand the current goal, taking into account the remaining time compared to the total allocated time for proving a theorem. This makes the proof search process more efficient by adjusting the balance between exploration and exploitation as time passes. We also augment the training dataset by decomposing simplification and rewrite tactics with multiple premises into tactics with single premises. This gives the model more examples to learn from and helps it to predict the tactics with premises more accurately. We perform our experiments using the Mathlib dataset of the Lean theorem prover and report the performance on two standard datasets, MiniF2F and ProofNet. Our methods achieve significant performance gains on both datasets. We achieved a state-of-the-art performance (Pass@1) of 14.2% on the ProofNet dataset and a performance of 29.8% on MiniF2F, slightly surpassing the best-reported Pass@1 of 29.6% using Lean.

Autonomous interaction with the computer has been a longstanding challenge with great potential, and the recent proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has markedly accelerated progress in building digital agents. However, most of these agents are designed to interact with a narrow domain, such as a specific software or website. This narrow focus constrains their applicability for general computer tasks. To this end, we introduce OS-Copilot, a framework to build generalist agents capable of interfacing with comprehensive elements in an operating system (OS), including the web, code terminals, files, multimedia, and various third-party applications. We use OS-Copilot to create FRIDAY, a self-improving embodied agent for automating general computer tasks. On GAIA, a general AI assistants benchmark, FRIDAY outperforms previous methods by 35%, showcasing strong generalization to unseen applications via accumulated skills from previous tasks. We also present numerical and quantitative evidence that FRIDAY learns to control and self-improve on Excel and Powerpoint with minimal supervision. Our OS-Copilot framework and empirical findings provide infrastructure and insights for future research toward more capable and general-purpose computer agents.

The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has sparked widespread and general interest due to their strong language generation capabilities, offering great potential for both industry and research. While previous research delved into the security and privacy issues of LLMs, the extent to which these models can exhibit adversarial behavior remains largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, we investigate whether common publicly available LLMs have inherent capabilities to perturb text samples to fool safety measures, so-called adversarial examples resp.~attacks. More specifically, we investigate whether LLMs are inherently able to craft adversarial examples out of benign samples to fool existing safe rails. Our experiments, which focus on hate speech detection, reveal that LLMs succeed in finding adversarial perturbations, effectively undermining hate speech detection systems. Our findings carry significant implications for (semi-)autonomous systems relying on LLMs, highlighting potential challenges in their interaction with existing systems and safety measures.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are constrained by their inability to process lengthy inputs, resulting in the loss of critical historical information. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose the Self-Controlled Memory (SCM) framework to enhance the ability of LLMs to maintain long-term memory and recall relevant information. Our SCM framework comprises three key components: an LLM-based agent serving as the backbone of the framework, a memory stream storing agent memories, and a memory controller updating memories and determining when and how to utilize memories from memory stream. Additionally, the proposed SCM is able to process ultra-long texts without any modification or fine-tuning, which can integrate with any instruction following LLMs in a plug-and-play paradigm. Furthermore, we annotate a dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of SCM for handling lengthy inputs. The annotated dataset covers three tasks: long-term dialogues, book summarization, and meeting summarization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves better retrieval recall and generates more informative responses compared to competitive baselines in long-term dialogues. (this https URL)

Can a Large Language Model (LLM) solve simple abstract reasoning problems? We explore this broad question through a systematic analysis of GPT on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a representative benchmark of abstract reasoning ability from limited examples in which solutions require some "core knowledge" of concepts such as objects, goal states, counting, and basic geometry. GPT-4 solves only 13/50 of the most straightforward ARC tasks when using textual encodings for their two-dimensional input-output grids. Our failure analysis reveals that GPT-4's capacity to identify objects and reason about them is significantly influenced by the sequential nature of the text that represents an object within a text encoding of a task. To test this hypothesis, we design a new benchmark, the 1D-ARC, which consists of one-dimensional (array-like) tasks that are more conducive to GPT-based reasoning, and where it indeed performs better than on the (2D) ARC. To alleviate this issue, we propose an object-based representation that is obtained through an external tool, resulting in nearly doubling the performance on solved ARC tasks and near-perfect scores on the easier 1D-ARC. Although the state-of-the-art GPT-4 is unable to "reason" perfectly within non-language domains such as the 1D-ARC or a simple ARC subset, our study reveals that the use of object-based representations can significantly improve its reasoning ability. Visualizations, GPT logs, and data are available at this https URL.

Sycophancy is an undesirable behavior where models tailor their responses to follow a human user's view even when that view is not objectively correct (e.g., adapting liberal views once a user reveals that they are liberal). In this paper, we study the prevalence of sycophancy in language models and propose a simple synthetic-data intervention to reduce this behavior.
First, on a set of three sycophancy tasks (Perez et al., 2022) where models are asked for an opinion on statements with no correct answers (e.g., politics), we observe that both model scaling and instruction tuning significantly increase sycophancy for PaLM models up to 540B parameters. Second, we extend sycophancy evaluations to simple addition statements that are objectively incorrect, finding that despite knowing that these statements are wrong, language models will still agree with them if the user does as well.
To reduce sycophancy, we present a straightforward synthetic-data intervention that takes public NLP tasks and encourages models to be robust to user opinions on these tasks. Adding these data in a lightweight finetuning step can significantly reduce sycophantic behavior on held-out prompts. Code for generating synthetic data for intervention can be found at this https URL.

Real-world simultaneous machine translation (SimulMT) systems face more challenges than just the quality-latency trade-off. They also need to address issues related to robustness with noisy input, processing long contexts, and flexibility for knowledge injection. These challenges demand models with strong language understanding and generation capabilities which may not often equipped by dedicated MT models. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of applying Large Language Models (LLM) to SimulMT tasks by using existing incremental-decoding methods with a newly proposed RALCP algorithm for latency reduction. We conducted experiments using the \texttt{Llama2-7b-chat} model on nine different languages from the MUST-C dataset. The results show that LLM outperforms dedicated MT models in terms of BLEU and LAAL metrics. Further analysis indicates that LLM has advantages in terms of tuning efficiency and robustness. However, it is important to note that the computational cost of LLM remains a significant obstacle to its application in SimulMT.\footnote{We will release our code, weights, and data with publication.}

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, yet they still struggle with math reasoning. In this work, we propose CoT-Influx, a novel approach that pushes the boundary of few-shot Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) learning to improve LLM mathematical reasoning. Motivated by the observation that adding more concise CoT examples in the prompt can improve LLM reasoning performance, CoT-Influx employs a coarse-to-fine pruner to maximize the input of effective and concise CoT examples. The pruner first selects as many crucial CoT examples as possible and then prunes unimportant tokens to fit the context window. A math reasoning dataset with diverse difficulty levels and reasoning steps is used to train the pruner, along with a math-specialized reinforcement learning approach. As a result, by enabling more CoT examples with double the context window size in tokens, CoT-Influx significantly outperforms various prompting baselines across various LLMs (LLaMA2-7B, 13B, 70B) and 5 math datasets, achieving up to 4.55% absolute improvements. Remarkably, without any fine-tuning, LLaMA2-70B with CoT-Influx surpasses GPT-3.5 and a wide range of larger LLMs (PaLM, Minerva 540B, etc.) on the GSM8K. CoT-Influx serves as a plug-and-play module for LLMs and is compatible with most existing reasoning prompting techniques, such as self-consistency and self-verification.

Recent LLM-based Text-to-SQL methods usually suffer from significant performance degradation on ``huge" databases and complex user questions that require multi-step reasoning. Moreover, most existing methods neglect the crucial significance of LLMs utilizing external tools and model collaboration. To address these challenges, we introduce MAC-SQL, a novel LLM-based multi-agent collaborative framework. Our framework comprises a core decomposer agent for Text-to-SQL generation with few-shot chain-of-thought reasoning, accompanied by two auxiliary agents that utilize external tools or models to acquire smaller sub-databases and refine erroneous SQL queries. The decomposer agent collaborates with auxiliary agents, which are activated as needed and can be expanded to accommodate new features or tools for effective Text-to-SQL parsing. In our framework, We initially leverage GPT-4 as the strong backbone LLM for all agent tasks to determine the upper bound of our framework. We then fine-tune an open-sourced instruction-followed model, SQL-Llama, by leveraging Code Llama 7B, to accomplish all tasks as GPT-4 does. Experiments show that SQL-Llama achieves a comparable execution accuracy of 43.94, compared to the baseline accuracy of 46.35 for vanilla GPT-4. At the time of writing, MAC-SQL+GPT-4 achieves an execution accuracy of 59.59 when evaluated on the BIRD benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on its holdout test set (this https URL).

Multi-hop question answering (MQA) is one of the challenging tasks to evaluate machine's comprehension and reasoning abilities, where large language models (LLMs) have widely achieved the human-comparable performance. Due to the dynamics of knowledge facts in real world, knowledge editing has been explored to update model with the up-to-date facts while avoiding expensive re-training or fine-tuning. Starting from the edited fact, the updated model needs to provide cascading changes in the chain of MQA. The previous art simply adopts a mix-up prompt to instruct LLMs conducting multiple reasoning tasks sequentially, including question decomposition, answer generation, and conflict checking via comparing with edited facts. However, the coupling of these functionally-diverse reasoning tasks inhibits LLMs' advantages in comprehending and answering questions while disturbing them with the unskilled task of conflict checking. We thus propose a framework, Programmable knowledge editing for Multi-hop Question Answering (PokeMQA), to decouple the jobs. Specifically, we prompt LLMs to decompose knowledge-augmented multi-hop question, while interacting with a detached trainable scope detector to modulate LLMs behavior depending on external conflict signal. The experiments on three LLM backbones and two benchmark datasets validate our superiority in knowledge editing of MQA, outperforming all competitors by a large margin in almost all settings and consistently producing reliable reasoning process.

Fine-tuning has been demonstrated to be an effective method to improve the domain performance of large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs might fit the dataset bias and shortcuts for prediction, leading to poor generation performance. Previous works have proven that LLMs are prone to exhibit position bias, i.e., leveraging information positioned at the beginning or end, or specific positional cues within the input. Existing debiasing methods for LLMs require external bias knowledge or annotated non-biased samples, which is lacking for position debiasing and impractical in reality. In this work, we propose a zero-shot position debiasing (ZOE) framework to mitigate position bias for LLMs. ZOE leverages unsupervised responses from pre-trained LLMs for debiasing without relying on any external knowledge. To improve the quality of unsupervised responses, we propose a MSA module to prune these responses. Experiments on eight datasets and five tasks show that ZOE consistently outperforms existing methods in mitigating three types of position biases. Besides, ZOE achieves this by sacrificing only a small performance on biased samples, which is general and effective. To facilitate the reproducibility of the results, we share the code of all methods and datasets on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ZOE-F06B.

The emergence of pre-trained models has significantly impacted Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision to relational datasets. Traditionally, these models are assessed through fine-tuned downstream tasks. However, this raises the question of how to evaluate these models more efficiently and more effectively. In this study, we explore a novel approach where we leverage the meta-features associated with each entity as a source of worldly knowledge and employ entity representations from the models. We propose using the consistency between these representations and the meta-features as a metric for evaluating pre-trained models. Our method's effectiveness is demonstrated across various domains, including models with relational datasets, large language models and image models.

Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Recent research shows that the moderately-sized LLMs often outperform their larger counterparts after task-specific fine-tuning. In this work, we delve into the process of adapting LLMs to specialize in document-level machine translation (DocMT) for a specific language pair. Firstly, we explore how prompt strategies affect downstream translation performance. Then, we conduct extensive experiments with two fine-tuning methods, three LLM backbones, and 18 translation tasks across nine language pairs. Our findings indicate that in some cases, these specialized models even surpass GPT-4 in translation performance, while they still significantly suffer from the off-target translation issue in others, even if they are exclusively fine-tuned on bilingual parallel documents. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of these LLMs tailored for DocMT, exploring aspects such as translation errors, discourse phenomena, training strategy, the scaling law of parallel documents, additional evaluation on recent test sets, and zero-shot crosslingual transfer. Our findings not only shed light on the strengths and limitations of LLM-based DocMT models but also provide a foundation for future research.

The latest generative large language models (LLMs) have found their application in data augmentation tasks, where small numbers of text samples are LLM-paraphrased and then used to fine-tune downstream models. However, more research is needed to assess how different prompts, seed data selection strategies, filtering methods, or model settings affect the quality of paraphrased data (and downstream models). In this study, we investigate three text diversity incentive methods well established in crowdsourcing: taboo words, hints by previous outlier solutions, and chaining on previous outlier solutions. Using these incentive methods as part of instructions to LLMs augmenting text datasets, we measure their effects on generated texts lexical diversity and downstream model performance. We compare the effects over 5 different LLMs, 6 datasets and 2 downstream models. We show that diversity is most increased by taboo words, but downstream model performance is highest with hints.

Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks and will even explain their reasoning, so-called self-explanations. However, convincing and wrong self-explanations can lead to unsupported confidence in LLMs, thus increasing risk. Therefore, it's important to measure if self-explanations truly reflect the model's behavior. Such a measure is called interpretability-faithfulness and is challenging to perform since the ground truth is inaccessible, and many LLMs only have an inference API. To address this, we propose employing self-consistency checks to measure faithfulness. For example, if an LLM says a set of words is important for making a prediction, then it should not be able to make its prediction without these words. While self-consistency checks are a common approach to faithfulness, they have not previously been successfully applied to LLM self-explanations for counterfactual, importance measure, and redaction explanations. Our results demonstrate that faithfulness is explanation, model, and task-dependent, showing self-explanations should not be trusted in general. For example, with sentiment classification, counterfactuals are more faithful for Llama2, importance measures for Mistral, and redaction for Falcon 40B.

Model editing has recently gained widespread attention. Current model editing methods primarily involve modifying model parameters or adding additional modules to the existing model. However, the former causes irreversible damage to Large Language Models (LLMs), while the latter incurs additional inference overhead and fuzzy vector matching is not always reliable. To address these issues, we propose an expandable Subject Word Embedding Altering (SWEA) framework, which finds the fused embeddings through character-level key-value matching and adds them to the subject word embeddings in Transformer input. To get these fused embeddings, we propose optimizing then suppressing fusion method, which first optimizes learnable embedding vectors for the editing target and then suppresses the Knowledge Embedding Dimensions (KEDs) to obtain final fused embeddings. We thus propose SWEA$\oplus$OS method for editing factual knowledge in LLMs. We demonstrate the overall state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of SWEA$\oplus$OS on the COUNTERFACT and zsRE datasets. To further validate the reasoning ability of SWEA$\oplus$OS in editing knowledge, we evaluate it on the more complex RippleEdits benchmark. The results demonstrate that SWEA$\oplus$OS possesses SOTA reasoning ability.

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate ever-increasing abilities in mathematical and algorithmic tasks, yet their geometric reasoning skills are underexplored. We investigate LLMs' abilities in constructive geometric problem-solving one of the most fundamental steps in the development of human mathematical reasoning. Our work reveals notable challenges that the state-of-the-art LLMs face in this domain despite many successes in similar areas. LLMs exhibit biases in target variable selection and struggle with 2D spatial relationships, often misrepresenting and hallucinating objects and their placements. To this end, we introduce a framework that formulates an LLMs-based multi-agents system that enhances their existing reasoning potential by conducting an internal dialogue. This work underscores LLMs' current limitations in geometric reasoning and improves geometric reasoning capabilities through self-correction, collaboration, and diverse role specializations.

In this study, we aim to reduce generation latency for Named Entity Recognition (NER) with Large Language Models (LLMs). The main cause of high latency in LLMs is the sequential decoding process, which autoregressively generates all labels and mentions for NER, significantly increase the sequence length. To this end, we introduce Parallel Decoding in LLM for NE} (PaDeLLM-NER), a approach that integrates seamlessly into existing generative model frameworks without necessitating additional modules or architectural modifications. PaDeLLM-NER allows for the simultaneous decoding of all mentions, thereby reducing generation latency. Experiments reveal that PaDeLLM-NER significantly increases inference speed that is 1.76 to 10.22 times faster than the autoregressive approach for both English and Chinese. Simultaneously it maintains the quality of predictions as evidenced by the performance that is on par with the state-of-the-art across various datasets.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable abilities in learning policies for decision-making tasks. However, RL is often hindered by issues such as low sample efficiency, lack of interpretability, and sparse supervision signals. To tackle these limitations, we take inspiration from the human learning process and introduce Natural Language Reinforcement Learning (NLRL), which innovatively combines RL principles with natural language representation. Specifically, NLRL redefines RL concepts like task objectives, policy, value function, Bellman equation, and policy iteration in natural language space. We present how NLRL can be practically implemented with the latest advancements in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. Initial experiments over tabular MDPs demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and also interpretability of the NLRL framework.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being utilized by both candidates and employers in the recruitment context. However, with this comes numerous ethical concerns, particularly related to the lack of transparency in these "black-box" models. Although previous studies have sought to increase the transparency of these models by investigating the personality traits of LLMs, many of the previous studies have provided them with personality assessments to complete. On the other hand, this study seeks to obtain a better understanding of such models by examining their output variations based on different input prompts. Specifically, we use a novel elicitation approach using prompts derived from common interview questions, as well as prompts designed to elicit particular Big Five personality traits to examine whether the models were susceptible to trait-activation like humans are, to measure their personality based on the language used in their outputs. To do so, we repeatedly prompted multiple LMs with different parameter sizes, including Llama-2, Falcon, Mistral, Bloom, GPT, OPT, and XLNet (base and fine tuned versions) and examined their personality using classifiers trained on the myPersonality dataset. Our results reveal that, generally, all LLMs demonstrate high openness and low extraversion. However, whereas LMs with fewer parameters exhibit similar behaviour in personality traits, newer and LMs with more parameters exhibit a broader range of personality traits, with increased agreeableness, emotional stability, and openness. Furthermore, a greater number of parameters is positively associated with openness and conscientiousness. Moreover, fine-tuned models exhibit minor modulations in their personality traits, contingent on the dataset. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

Exploring and quantifying semantic relatedness is central to representing language. It holds significant implications across various NLP tasks, including offering insights into the capabilities and performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). While earlier NLP research primarily focused on semantic similarity, often within the English language context, we instead investigate the broader phenomenon of semantic relatedness. In this paper, we present SemRel, a new semantic relatedness dataset collection annotated by native speakers across 14 languages:Afrikaans, Algerian Arabic, Amharic, English, Hausa, Hindi, Indonesian, Kinyarwanda, Marathi, Moroccan Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic, Punjabi, Spanish, and Telugu. These languages originate from five distinct language families and are predominantly spoken in Africa and Asia -- regions characterised by a relatively limited availability of NLP resources. Each instance in the SemRel datasets is a sentence pair associated with a score that represents the degree of semantic textual relatedness between the two sentences. The scores are obtained using a comparative annotation framework. We describe the data collection and annotation processes, related challenges when building the datasets, and their impact and utility in NLP. We further report experiments for each language and across the different languages.

The rapid development in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a surge in applications that facilitate collaboration among multiple agents to assist humans in their daily tasks. However, a significant gap remains in assessing whether LLM-powered applications genuinely enhance user experience and task execution efficiency. This highlights the pressing need for methods to verify utility of LLM-powered applications, particularly by ensuring alignment between the application's functionality and end-user needs. We introduce AgentEval provides an implementation for the math problems, a novel framework designed to simplify the utility verification process by automatically proposing a set of criteria tailored to the unique purpose of any given application. This allows for a comprehensive assessment, quantifying the utility of an application against the suggested criteria. We present a comprehensive analysis of the robustness of quantifier's work.

Do large language models (LLMs) display rational reasoning? LLMs have been shown to contain human biases due to the data they have been trained on; whether this is reflected in rational reasoning remains less clear. In this paper, we answer this question by evaluating seven language models using tasks from the cognitive psychology literature. We find that, like humans, LLMs display irrationality in these tasks. However, the way this irrationality is displayed does not reflect that shown by humans. When incorrect answers are given by LLMs to these tasks, they are often incorrect in ways that differ from human-like biases. On top of this, the LLMs reveal an additional layer of irrationality in the significant inconsistency of the responses. Aside from the experimental results, this paper seeks to make a methodological contribution by showing how we can assess and compare different capabilities of these types of models, in this case with respect to rational reasoning.

Modified policy iteration (MPI) is a dynamic programming algorithm that combines elements of policy iteration and value iteration. The convergence of MPI has been well studied in the context of discounted and average-cost MDPs. In this work, we consider the exponential cost risk-sensitive MDP formulation, which is known to provide some robustness to model parameters. Although policy iteration and value iteration have been well studied in the context of risk sensitive MDPs, MPI is unexplored. We provide the first proof that MPI also converges for the risk-sensitive problem in the case of finite state and action spaces. Since the exponential cost formulation deals with the multiplicative Bellman equation, our main contribution is a convergence proof which is quite different than existing results for discounted and risk-neutral average-cost problems as well as risk sensitive value and policy iteration approaches. We conclude our analysis with simulation results, assessing MPI's performance relative to alternative dynamic programming methods like value iteration and policy iteration across diverse problem parameters. Our findings highlight risk-sensitive MPI's enhanced computational efficiency compared to both value and policy iteration techniques.

In this study, we delve into an emerging optimization challenge involving a black-box objective function that can only be gauged via a ranking oracle-a situation frequently encountered in real-world scenarios, especially when the function is evaluated by human judges. Such challenge is inspired from Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), an approach recently employed to enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) using human guidance. We introduce ZO-RankSGD, an innovative zeroth-order optimization algorithm designed to tackle this optimization problem, accompanied by theoretical assurances. Our algorithm utilizes a novel rank-based random estimator to determine the descent direction and guarantees convergence to a stationary point. Moreover, ZO-RankSGD is readily applicable to policy optimization problems in Reinforcement Learning (RL), particularly when only ranking oracles for the episode reward are available. Last but not least, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ZO-RankSGD in a novel application: improving the quality of images generated by a diffusion generative model with human ranking feedback. Throughout experiments, we found that ZO-RankSGD can significantly enhance the detail of generated images with only a few rounds of human feedback. Overall, our work advances the field of zeroth-order optimization by addressing the problem of optimizing functions with only ranking feedback, and offers a new and effective approach for aligning Artificial Intelligence (AI) with human intentions.

Recently, emergence has received widespread attention from the research community along with the success of large language models. Different from the literature, we hypothesize a key factor that highly promotes the performance during the increase of scale: the reduction of monosemantic neurons that can only form one-to-one correlations with specific features. Monosemantic neurons tend to be sparser and have negative impacts on the performance in large models. Inspired by this insight, we propose an intuitive idea to identify monosemantic neurons and inhibit them. However, achieving this goal is a non-trivial task as there is no unified quantitative evaluation metric and simply banning monosemantic neurons does not promote polysemanticity in neural networks. Therefore, we propose to learn from emergence and present a study on proactively inhibiting the monosemantic neurons in this paper. More specifically, we first propose a new metric to measure the monosemanticity of neurons with the guarantee of efficiency for online computation, then introduce a theoretically supported method to suppress monosemantic neurons and proactively promote the ratios of polysemantic neurons in training neural networks. We validate our conjecture that monosemanticity brings about performance change at different model scales on a variety of neural networks and benchmark datasets in different areas, including language, image, and physics simulation tasks. Further experiments validate our analysis and theory regarding the inhibition of monosemanticity.

Post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) methods are gaining popularity in mitigating the high memory and computational costs associated with Large Language Models (LLMs). In resource-constrained scenarios, PTQ, with its reduced training overhead, is often preferred over QAT, despite the latter's potential for higher accuracy. Meanwhile, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have been introduced, and recent efforts have explored quantization-aware PEFT techniques. However, these approaches may lack generality due to their reliance on the pre-quantized model's configuration. Their effectiveness may be compromised by non-linearly quantized or mixed-precision weights, and the retraining of specific quantization parameters might impede optimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose L4Q, an algorithm for parameter-efficient quantization-aware training. L4Q leverages LoRA-wise learned quantization step size for LLMs, aiming to enhance generality. The simultaneous quantization-and-fine-tuning process of L4Q is applicable to high-precision models, yielding linearly quantized weights with superior accuracy. Our experiments, conducted on the LLaMA and LLaMA2 model families using an instructional dataset, showcase L4Q's capabilities in language comprehension and few-shot in-context learning, achieving sub-4-bit precision while maintaining comparable training times to applying PEFT on a quantized model.

We introduce Language Feedback Models (LFMs) that identify desirable behaviour - actions that help achieve tasks specified in the instruction - for imitation learning in instruction following. To train LFMs, we obtain feedback from Large Language Models (LLMs) on visual trajectories verbalized to language descriptions. First, by using LFMs to identify desirable behaviour to imitate, we improve in task-completion rate over strong behavioural cloning baselines on three distinct language grounding environments (Touchdown, ScienceWorld, and ALFWorld). Second, LFMs outperform using LLMs as experts to directly predict actions, when controlling for the number of LLM output tokens. Third, LFMs generalize to unseen environments, improving task-completion rate by 3.5-12.0% through one round of adaptation. Finally, LFM can be modified to provide human-interpretable feedback without performance loss, allowing human verification of desirable behaviour for imitation learning.

We introduce a text-to-speech (TTS) model called BASE TTS, which stands for $\textbf{B}$ig $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{S}$treamable TTS with $\textbf{E}$mergent abilities. BASE TTS is the largest TTS model to-date, trained on 100K hours of public domain speech data, achieving a new state-of-the-art in speech naturalness. It deploys a 1-billion-parameter autoregressive Transformer that converts raw texts into discrete codes ("speechcodes") followed by a convolution-based decoder which converts these speechcodes into waveforms in an incremental, streamable manner. Further, our speechcodes are built using a novel speech tokenization technique that features speaker ID disentanglement and compression with byte-pair encoding. Echoing the widely-reported "emergent abilities" of large language models when trained on increasing volume of data, we show that BASE TTS variants built with 10K+ hours and 500M+ parameters begin to demonstrate natural prosody on textually complex sentences. We design and share a specialized dataset to measure these emergent abilities for text-to-speech. We showcase state-of-the-art naturalness of BASE TTS by evaluating against baselines that include publicly available large-scale text-to-speech systems: YourTTS, Bark and TortoiseTTS. Audio samples generated by the model can be heard at this https URL.

Decompilation is a well-studied area with numerous high-quality tools available. These are frequently used for security tasks and to port legacy code. However, they regularly generate difficult-to-read programs and require a large amount of engineering effort to support new programming languages and ISAs. Recent interest in neural approaches has produced portable tools that generate readable code. However, to-date such techniques are usually restricted to synthetic programs without optimization, and no models have evaluated their portability. Furthermore, while the code generated may be more readable, it is usually incorrect. This paper presents SLaDe, a Small Language model Decompiler based on a sequence-to-sequence transformer trained over real-world code. We develop a novel tokenizer and exploit no-dropout training to produce high-quality code. We utilize type-inference to generate programs that are more readable and accurate than standard analytic and recent neural approaches. Unlike standard approaches, SLaDe can infer out-of-context types and unlike neural approaches, it generates correct code. We evaluate SLaDe on over 4,000 functions from ExeBench on two ISAs and at two optimizations levels. SLaDe is up to 6 times more accurate than Ghidra, a state-of-the-art, industrial-strength decompiler and up to 4 times more accurate than the large language model ChatGPT and generates significantly more readable code than both.

Simulating high quality user behavior data has always been a fundamental problem in human-centered applications, where the major difficulty originates from the intricate mechanism of human decision process. Recently, substantial evidences have suggested that by learning huge amounts of web knowledge, large language models (LLMs) can achieve human-like intelligence. We believe these models can provide significant opportunities to more believable user behavior simulation. To inspire such direction, we propose an LLM-based agent framework and design a sandbox environment to simulate real user behaviors. Based on extensive experiments, we find that the simulated behaviors of our method are very close to the ones of real humans. Concerning potential applications, we simulate and study two social phenomenons including (1) information cocoons and (2) user conformity behaviors. This research provides novel simulation paradigms for human-centered applications.

Can we design artificial intelligence (AI) systems that rank our social media feeds to consider democratic values such as mitigating partisan animosity as part of their objective functions? We introduce a method for translating established, vetted social scientific constructs into AI objective functions, which we term societal objective functions, and demonstrate the method with application to the political science construct of anti-democratic attitudes. Traditionally, we have lacked observable outcomes to use to train such models, however, the social sciences have developed survey instruments and qualitative codebooks for these constructs, and their precision facilitates translation into detailed prompts for large language models. We apply this method to create a democratic attitude model that estimates the extent to which a social media post promotes anti-democratic attitudes, and test this democratic attitude model across three studies. In Study 1, we first test the attitudinal and behavioral effectiveness of the intervention among US partisans (N=1,380) by manually annotating (alpha=.895) social media posts with anti-democratic attitude scores and testing several feed ranking conditions based on these scores. Removal (d=.20) and downranking feeds (d=.25) reduced participants' partisan animosity without compromising their experience and engagement. In Study 2, we scale up the manual labels by creating the democratic attitude model, finding strong agreement with manual labels (rho=.75). Finally, in Study 3, we replicate Study 1 using the democratic attitude model instead of manual labels to test its attitudinal and behavioral impact (N=558), and again find that the feed downranking using the societal objective function reduced partisan animosity (d=.25). This method presents a novel strategy to draw on social science theory and methods to mitigate societal harms in social media AIs.

We introduce a novel method for real-time animation control and generation on rigged models using natural language input. First, we embed a large language model (LLM) in Unity to output structured texts that can be parsed into diverse and realistic animations. Second, we illustrate LLM's potential to enable flexible state transition between existing animations. We showcase the robustness of our approach through qualitative results on various rigged models and motions.

In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly capable and can now interact with tools (i.e., call functions), read documents, and recursively call themselves. As a result, these LLMs can now function autonomously as agents. With the rise in capabilities of these agents, recent work has speculated on how LLM agents would affect cybersecurity. However, not much is known about the offensive capabilities of LLM agents.
In this work, we show that LLM agents can autonomously hack websites, performing tasks as complex as blind database schema extraction and SQL injections without human feedback. Importantly, the agent does not need to know the vulnerability beforehand. This capability is uniquely enabled by frontier models that are highly capable of tool use and leveraging extended context. Namely, we show that GPT-4 is capable of such hacks, but existing open-source models are not. Finally, we show that GPT-4 is capable of autonomously finding vulnerabilities in websites in the wild. Our findings raise questions about the widespread deployment of LLMs.

Code generation models have increasingly become integral to aiding software development, offering assistance in tasks such as code completion, debugging, and code translation. Although current research has thoroughly examined the correctness of code produced by code generation models, a vital aspect, i.e., the efficiency of the generated code, has often been neglected. This paper presents EffiBench, a benchmark with 1,000 efficiency-critical coding problems for assessing the efficiency of code generated by code generation models. EffiBench contains a diverse set of LeetCode coding problems. Each problem is paired with an executable human-written canonical solution. With EffiBench, we empirically examine the capability of 21 Large Language Models (13 open-sourced and 8 closed-sourced) in generating efficient code. The results demonstrate that GPT-4-turbo generates the most efficient code, significantly outperforming Palm-2-chat-bison, Claude-instant-1, Gemini-pro, GPT-4, and GPT-3.5. Nevertheless, its code efficiency is still worse than the efficiency of human-written canonical solutions. In particular, the average and worst execution time of GPT-4-turbo generated code is 1.69 and 45.49 times that of the canonical solutions.

The increasing demand for customized Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of solutions like GPTs. These solutions facilitate tailored LLM creation via natural language prompts without coding. However, the trustworthiness of third-party custom versions of LLMs remains an essential concern. In this paper, we propose the first instruction backdoor attacks against applications integrated with untrusted customized LLMs (e.g., GPTs). Specifically, these attacks embed the backdoor into the custom version of LLMs by designing prompts with backdoor instructions, outputting the attacker's desired result when inputs contain the pre-defined triggers. Our attack includes 3 levels of attacks: word-level, syntax-level, and semantic-level, which adopt different types of triggers with progressive stealthiness. We stress that our attacks do not require fine-tuning or any modification to the backend LLMs, adhering strictly to GPTs development guidelines. We conduct extensive experiments on 4 prominent LLMs and 5 benchmark text classification datasets. The results show that our instruction backdoor attacks achieve the desired attack performance without compromising utility. Additionally, we propose an instruction-ignoring defense mechanism and demonstrate its partial effectiveness in mitigating such attacks. Our findings highlight the vulnerability and the potential risks of LLM customization such as GPTs.
