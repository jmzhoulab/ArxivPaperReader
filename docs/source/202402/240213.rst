Large language models (LLMs), while promising, face criticisms for biases, hallucinations, and a lack of reasoning capability. This paper introduces SocraSynth, a multi-LLM agent reasoning platform developed to mitigate these issues. SocraSynth utilizes conditional statistics and systematic context enhancement through continuous arguments, alongside adjustable debate contentiousness levels. The platform typically involves a human moderator and two LLM agents representing opposing viewpoints on a given subject. SocraSynth operates in two main phases: knowledge generation and reasoning evaluation. In the knowledge generation phase, the moderator defines the debate topic and contentiousness level, prompting the agents to formulate supporting arguments for their respective stances. The reasoning evaluation phase then employs Socratic reasoning and formal logic principles to appraise the quality of the arguments presented. The dialogue concludes with the moderator adjusting the contentiousness from confrontational to collaborative, gathering final, conciliatory remarks to aid in human reasoning and decision-making. Through case studies in three distinct application domains, this paper showcases SocraSynth's effectiveness in fostering rigorous research, dynamic reasoning, comprehensive assessment, and enhanced collaboration. This underscores the value of multi-agent interactions in leveraging LLMs for advanced knowledge extraction and decision-making support.

Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) are always seen as limitations. However, could they also be a source of creativity? This survey explores this possibility, suggesting that hallucinations may contribute to LLM application by fostering creativity. This survey begins with a review of the taxonomy of hallucinations and their negative impact on LLM reliability in critical applications. Then, through historical examples and recent relevant theories, the survey explores the potential creative benefits of hallucinations in LLMs. To elucidate the value and evaluation criteria of this connection, we delve into the definitions and assessment methods of creativity. Following the framework of divergent and convergent thinking phases, the survey systematically reviews the literature on transforming and harnessing hallucinations for creativity in LLMs. Finally, the survey discusses future research directions, emphasizing the need to further explore and refine the application of hallucinations in creative processes within LLMs.

The transition from CPS-based Industry 4.0 to CPSS-based Industry 5.0 brings new requirements and opportunities to current sensing approaches, especially in light of recent progress in Chatbots and Large Language Models (LLMs).
Therefore, the advancement of parallel intelligence-powered Crowdsensing Intelligence (CSI) is witnessed, which is currently advancing towards linguistic intelligence. In this paper, we propose a novel sensing paradigm, namely conversational crowdsensing, for Industry 5.0. It can alleviate workload and professional requirements of individuals and promote the organization and operation of diverse workforce, thereby facilitating faster response and wider popularization of crowdsensing systems. Specifically, we design the architecture of conversational crowdsensing to effectively organize three types of participants (biological, robotic, and digital) from diverse communities.
Through three levels of effective conversation (i.e., inter-human, human-AI, and inter-AI), complex interactions and service functionalities of different workers can be achieved to accomplish various tasks across three sensing phases (i.e., requesting, scheduling, and executing). Moreover, we explore the foundational technologies for realizing conversational crowdsensing, encompassing LLM-based multi-agent systems, scenarios engineering and conversational human-AI cooperation. Finally, we present potential industrial applications of conversational crowdsensing and discuss its implications. We envision that conversations in natural language will become the primary communication channel during crowdsensing process, enabling richer information exchange and cooperative problem-solving among humans, robots, and AI.

Integrating large language models (LLMs) with knowledge graphs derived from domain-specific data represents an important advancement towards more powerful and factual reasoning. As these models grow more capable, it is crucial to enable them to perform multi-step inferences over real-world knowledge graphs while minimizing hallucination. While large language models excel at conversation and text generation, their ability to reason over domain-specialized graphs of interconnected entities remains limited. For example, can we query a LLM to identify the optimal contact in a professional network for a specific goal, based on relationships and attributes in a private database? The answer is no--such capabilities lie beyond current methods.
However, this question underscores a critical technical gap that must be addressed. Many high-value applications in areas such as science, security, and e-commerce rely on proprietary knowledge graphs encoding unique structures, relationships, and logical constraints. We introduce a fine-tuning framework for developing Graph-aligned LAnguage Models (GLaM) that transforms a knowledge graph into an alternate text representation with labeled question-answer pairs.
We demonstrate that grounding the models in specific graph-based knowledge expands the models' capacity for structure-based reasoning. Our methodology leverages the large-language model's generative capabilities to create the dataset and proposes an efficient alternate to retrieval-augmented generation styled methods.

Common methods for aligning large language models (LLMs) with desired behaviour heavily rely on human-labelled data. However, as models grow increasingly sophisticated, they will surpass human expertise, and the role of human evaluation will evolve into non-experts overseeing experts. In anticipation of this, we ask: can weaker models assess the correctness of stronger models? We investigate this question in an analogous setting, where stronger models (experts) possess the necessary information to answer questions and weaker models (non-experts) lack this information. The method we evaluate is \textit{debate}, where two LLM experts each argue for a different answer, and a non-expert selects the answer. We find that debate consistently helps both non-expert models and humans answer questions, achieving 76\% and 88\% accuracy respectively (naive baselines obtain 48\% and 60\%). Furthermore, optimising expert debaters for persuasiveness in an unsupervised manner improves non-expert ability to identify the truth in debates. Our results provide encouraging empirical evidence for the viability of aligning models with debate in the absence of ground truth.

Large language models (LLMs) have made impressive progress in chemistry applications, including molecular property prediction, molecular generation, experimental protocol design, etc. However, the community lacks a dialogue-based model specifically designed for chemistry. The challenge arises from the fact that most chemical data and scientific knowledge are primarily stored in structured databases, and the direct use of these structured data compromises the model's ability to maintain coherent dialogue. To tackle this issue, we develop a novel template-based instruction construction method that transforms structured knowledge into plain dialogue, making it suitable for language model training. By leveraging this approach, we develop ChemLLM, the first large language model dedicated to chemistry, capable of performing various tasks across chemical disciplines with smooth dialogue interaction.
ChemLLM beats GPT-3.5 on all three principal tasks in chemistry, i.e., name conversion, molecular caption, and reaction prediction, and surpasses GPT-4 on two of them. Remarkably, ChemLLM also shows exceptional adaptability to related mathematical and physical tasks despite being trained mainly on chemical-centric corpora. Furthermore, ChemLLM demonstrates proficiency in specialized NLP tasks within chemistry, such as literature translation and cheminformatic programming. ChemLLM opens up a new avenue for exploration within chemical studies, while our method of integrating structured chemical knowledge into dialogue systems sets a new frontier for developing LLMs across various scientific fields. Codes, Datasets, and Model weights are publicly accessible at hf.co/AI4Chem/ChemLLM-7B-Chat.

Urban knowledge graph has recently worked as an emerging building block to distill critical knowledge from multi-sourced urban data for diverse urban application scenarios. Despite its promising benefits, urban knowledge graph construction (UrbanKGC) still heavily relies on manual effort, hindering its potential advancement. This paper presents UrbanKGent, a unified large language model agent framework, for urban knowledge graph construction. Specifically, we first construct the knowledgeable instruction set for UrbanKGC tasks (such as relational triplet extraction and knowledge graph completion) via heterogeneity-aware and geospatial-infused instruction generation. Moreover, we propose a tool-augmented iterative trajectory refinement module to enhance and refine the trajectories distilled from GPT-4. Through hybrid instruction fine-tuning with augmented trajectories on Llama-2-13B, we obtain the UrbanKGC agent, UrbanKGent-13B. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on two real-world datasets using both human and GPT-4 self-evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate that UrbanKGent-13B not only can significantly outperform 21 baselines in UrbanKGC tasks, but also surpass the state-of-the-art LLM, GPT-4, by more than 10\% with approximately 20 times lower cost. We deploy UrbanKGent-13B to provide online services, which can construct an UrbanKG with thousands of times richer relationships using only one-fifth of the data compared with the existing benchmark. Our data, code, and opensource UrbanKGC agent are available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/UrbanKGent.

The integration of multimodal Electronic Health Records (EHR) data has significantly improved clinical predictive capabilities. Leveraging clinical notes and multivariate time-series EHR, existing models often lack the medical context relevent to clinical tasks, prompting the incorporation of external knowledge, particularly from the knowledge graph (KG). Previous approaches with KG knowledge have primarily focused on structured knowledge extraction, neglecting unstructured data modalities and semantic high dimensional medical knowledge. In response, we propose REALM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) driven framework to enhance multimodal EHR representations that address these limitations. Firstly, we apply Large Language Model (LLM) to encode long context clinical notes and GRU model to encode time-series EHR data. Secondly, we prompt LLM to extract task-relevant medical entities and match entities in professionally labeled external knowledge graph (PrimeKG) with corresponding medical knowledge. By matching and aligning with clinical standards, our framework eliminates hallucinations and ensures consistency. Lastly, we propose an adaptive multimodal fusion network to integrate extracted knowledge with multimodal EHR data. Our extensive experiments on MIMIC-III mortality and readmission tasks showcase the superior performance of our REALM framework over baselines, emphasizing the effectiveness of each module. REALM framework contributes to refining the use of multimodal EHR data in healthcare and bridging the gap with nuanced medical context essential for informed clinical predictions.

In recent years, Large Language Models have reached state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains. However, the progress in the field of graph reasoning remains limited. Our work delves into this gap by thoroughly investigating graph reasoning with LLM. In this work, we reveal the impact of text sequence on LLM spatial understanding, finding that graph-descriptive text sequences significantly affect LLM reasoning performance on graphs. By altering the graph-descriptive text sequences, we enhance the performance of LLM from 42.22\% to 70\%. Furthermore, we evaluate the relationship between LLM performance and graph size, discovering that the reasoning performance of LLM does not monotonically decrease with the increase in graph size. Conclusively, we introduce the Scaled Graph Reasoning benchmark for assessing LLM performance across varied graph sizes.

We provide a birds eye view of the rapid developments in AI and Deep Learning that has led to the path-breaking emergence of AI in Large Language Models. The aim of this study is to place all these developments in a pragmatic broader historical social perspective without any exaggerations while at the same time without any pessimism that created the AI winter in the 1970s to 1990s. We also at the same time point out toxicity, bias, memorization, sycophancy, logical inconsistencies, hallucinations that exist just as a warning to the overly optimistic. We note here that just as this emergence of AI seems to occur at a threshold point in the number of neural connections or weights, it has also been observed that human brain and especially the cortex region is nothing special or extraordinary but simply a case of scaled-up version of the primate brain and that even the human intelligence seems like an emergent phenomena of scale.

Treatment planning is currently a patient specific, time-consuming, and resource demanding task in radiotherapy. Dose-volume histogram (DVH) prediction plays a critical role in automating this process. The geometric relationship between DVHs in radiotherapy plans and organs-at-risk (OAR) and planning target volume (PTV) has been well established. This study explores the potential of deep learning models for predicting DVHs using images and subsequent human intervention facilitated by a large-language model (LLM) to enhance the planning quality. We propose a pipeline to convert unstructured images to a structured graph consisting of image-patch nodes and dose nodes. A novel Dose Graph Neural Network (DoseGNN) model is developed for predicting DVHs from the structured graph. The proposed DoseGNN is enhanced with the LLM to encode massive knowledge from prescriptions and interactive instructions from clinicians. In this study, we introduced an online human-AI collaboration (OHAC) system as a practical implementation of the concept proposed for the automation of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) planning. In comparison to the widely-employed DL models used in radiotherapy, DoseGNN achieved mean square errors that were 80$\%$, 76$\%$ and 41.0$\%$ of those predicted by Swin U-Net Transformer, 3D U-Net CNN and vanilla MLP, respectively. Moreover, the LLM-empowered DoseGNN model facilitates seamless adjustment to treatment plans through interaction with clinicians using natural language.

Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, exhibit powerful zero-shot and instruction-following capabilities, have catalyzed a revolutionary transformation across diverse research fields of artificial intelligence, especially for open-ended tasks. While the idea is less explored in the graph domain, despite the availability of numerous powerful graph models (GMs), they are restricted to tasks in a pre-defined form. Although several methods applying LLMs to graphs have been proposed, they fail to simultaneously handle the pre-defined and open-ended tasks, with LLM as a node feature enhancer or as a standalone predictor. To break this dilemma, we propose to bridge the pretrained GM and LLM by a Translator, named GraphTranslator, aiming to leverage GM to handle the pre-defined tasks effectively and utilize the extended interface of LLMs to offer various open-ended tasks for GM. To train such Translator, we propose a Producer capable of constructing the graph-text alignment data along node information, neighbor information and model information. By treating the node representation as a type of language, the proposed GraphTranslator empowers an LLM to make predictions based on node representation and language instructions, providing a unified perspective for both pre-defined and open-ended tasks. Extensive results show that the proposed GraphTranslator effectively improves the results of zero-shot node classification. The graph question answering experiments reveal our GraphTranslator potential across a broad spectrum of open-ended applications through language instructions.

In this paper, we for the first time propose the task of Open-domain Urban Itinerary Planning (OUIP) for citywalk, which directly generates itineraries based on users' requests described in natural language. OUIP is different from conventional itinerary planning, which limits users from expressing more detailed needs and hinders true personalization. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in handling diverse tasks. However, due to non-real-time information, incomplete knowledge, and insufficient spatial awareness, they are unable to independently deliver a satisfactory user experience in OUIP. Given this, we present ItiNera, an OUIP system that synergizes spatial optimization with Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide services that customize urban itineraries based on users' needs. Specifically, we develop an LLM-based pipeline for extracting and updating POI features to create a user-owned personalized POI database. For each user request, we leverage LLM in cooperation with an embedding-based module for retrieving candidate POIs from the user's POI database. Then, a spatial optimization module is used to order these POIs, followed by LLM crafting a personalized, spatially coherent itinerary. To the best of our knowledge, this study marks the first integration of LLMs to innovate itinerary planning solutions.
Extensive experiments on offline datasets and online subjective evaluation have demonstrated the capacities of our system to deliver more responsive and spatially coherent itineraries than current LLM-based solutions. Our system has been deployed in production at the TuTu online travel service and has attracted thousands of users for their urban travel planning.

Autonomous interaction with the computer has been a longstanding challenge with great potential, and the recent proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has markedly accelerated progress in building digital agents. However, most of these agents are designed to interact with a narrow domain, such as a specific software or website. This narrow focus constrains their applicability for general computer tasks. To this end, we introduce OS-Copilot, a framework to build generalist agents capable of interfacing with comprehensive elements in an operating system (OS), including the web, code terminals, files, multimedia, and various third-party applications. We use OS-Copilot to create FRIDAY, a self-improving embodied agent for automating general computer tasks.
On GAIA, a general AI assistants benchmark, FRIDAY outperforms previous methods by 35%, showcasing strong generalization to unseen applications via accumulated skills from previous tasks. We also present numerical and quantitative evidence that FRIDAY learns to control and self-improve on Excel and Powerpoint with minimal supervision. Our OS-Copilot framework and empirical findings provide infrastructure and insights for future research toward more capable and general-purpose computer agents.

State-of-the-art rule-based and classification-based food recommendation systems face significant challenges in becoming practical and useful. This difficulty arises primarily because most machine learning models struggle with problems characterized by an almost infinite number of classes and a limited number of samples within an unbalanced dataset. Conversely, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) as recommendation engines offers a promising avenue. However, a general-purpose Recommendation as Language Processing (RLP) approach lacks the critical components necessary for effective food recommendations. To address this gap, we introduce Food Recommendation as Language Processing (F-RLP), a novel framework that offers a food-specific, tailored infrastructure. F-RLP leverages the capabilities of LLMs to maximize their potential, thereby paving the way for more accurate, personalized food recommendations.

Large Language Models (LLM) have shown remarkable language capabilities fueling attempts to integrate them into applications across a wide range of domains. An important application area is question answering over private enterprise documents where the main considerations are data security, which necessitates applications that can be deployed on-prem, limited computational resources and the need for a robust application that correctly responds to queries. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the most prominent framework for building LLM-based applications. While building a RAG is relatively straightforward, making it robust and a reliable application requires extensive customization and relatively deep knowledge of the application domain. We share our experiences building and deploying an LLM application for question answering over private organizational documents. Our application combines the use of RAG with a finetuned open-source LLM.
Additionally, our system, which we call Tree-RAG (T-RAG), uses a tree structure to represent entity hierarchies within the organization. This is used to generate a textual description to augment the context when responding to user queries pertaining to entities within the organization's hierarchy. Our evaluations show that this combination performs better than a simple RAG or finetuning implementation. Finally, we share some lessons learned based on our experiences building an LLM application for real-world use.

Recent capability increases in large language models (LLMs) open up applications in which teams of communicating generative AI agents solve joint tasks. This poses privacy and security challenges concerning the unauthorised sharing of information, or other unwanted forms of agent coordination. Modern steganographic techniques could render such dynamics hard to detect. In this paper, we comprehensively formalise the problem of secret collusion in systems of generative AI agents by drawing on relevant concepts from both the AI and security literature. We study incentives for the use of steganography, and propose a variety of mitigation measures. Our investigations result in a model evaluation framework that systematically tests capabilities required for various forms of secret collusion. We provide extensive empirical results across a range of contemporary LLMs. While the steganographic capabilities of current models remain limited, GPT-4 displays a capability jump suggesting the need for continuous monitoring of steganographic frontier model capabilities.
We conclude by laying out a comprehensive research program to mitigate future risks of collusion between generative AI models.

The questions are created through a collaborative process, i.e., merging expert knowledge with LLMs, including GPT-3.5 and Falcon-180B. Human experts spent over 200 hours verifying their accuracy and relevance. Beyond assessing LLMs' knowledge, the dataset's main goal is to facilitate a fair comparison between humans and different LLMs in cybersecurity. To achieve this, we carefully selected 80 questions covering a wide range of topics within cybersecurity and involved 30 participants of diverse expertise levels, facilitating a comprehensive comparison between human and machine intelligence in this area. The findings revealed that LLMs outperformed humans in almost every aspect of cybersecurity.

The recent advancement of large language models (LLMs) represents a transformational capability at the frontier of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). However, LLMs are generalized models, trained on extensive text corpus, and often struggle to provide context-specific information, particularly in areas requiring specialized knowledge such as wildfire details within the broader context of climate change. For decision-makers and policymakers focused on wildfire resilience and adaptation, it is crucial to obtain responses that are not only precise but also domain-specific, rather than generic. To that end, we developed WildfireGPT, a prototype LLM agent designed to transform user queries into actionable insights on wildfire risks. We enrich WildfireGPT by providing additional context such as climate projections and scientific literature to ensure its information is current, relevant, and scientifically accurate. This enables WildfireGPT to be an effective tool for delivering detailed, user-specific insights on wildfire risks to support a diverse set of end users, including researchers, engineers, urban planners, emergency managers, and infrastructure operators.

Recent works have shown that large language models (LLMs) work remarkably well on a wide range of tasks through in-context learning and optimization of in-context examples (ICE). However, most of these studies assume either a fixed or no instruction provided in the prompt, leading to the apparent consensus that the optimization of in-context examples is critical for better performance. We challenge this consensus for instruction-tuned LLMs by investigating the necessity of optimizing in-context examples when task-specific instructions are provided, and find that there are tasks for which various ways of optimizing in-context examples yield diminishing returns.
We introduce a task-specific metric called \metriclong{} (\metric) that quantifies the learnability of tasks from a given instruction, and provides a heuristic that helps decide whether to optimize for instructions or ICE for any new task. On a wide range of tasks and a systematically created instruction set with gradually added details, we validate our hypothesis empirically by computing \metric with query-dependent bins of examples, comparing different instructions with ICE selection methods, and performing label perturbation experiments. We conclude that tasks can be divided into two broad classes based on the \metric metric, where the returns on ICE optimization follow predictable trends when instructions are provided in the prompt.

The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate factually correct output remains relatively unexplored due to the lack of fact-checking and knowledge grounding during training and inference. In this work, we aim to address this challenge through the Entity Disambiguation (ED) task. We first consider prompt engineering, and design a three-step hard-prompting method to probe LLMs' ED performance without supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Overall, the prompting method improves the micro-F_1 score of the original vanilla models by a large margin, on some cases up to 36% and higher, and obtains comparable performance across 10 datasets when compared to existing methods with SFT. We further improve the knowledge grounding ability through instruction tuning (IT) with similar prompts and responses. The instruction-tuned model not only achieves higher micro-F1 score performance as compared to several baseline methods on supervised entity disambiguation tasks with an average micro-F_1 improvement of 2.1% over the existing baseline models, but also obtains higher accuracy on six Question Answering (QA) tasks in the zero-shot setting. Our methodologies apply to both open- and closed-source LLMs.

Language models serve as a cornerstone in natural language processing (NLP), utilizing mathematical methods to generalize language laws and knowledge for prediction and generation. Over extensive research spanning decades, language modeling has progressed from initial statistical language models (SLMs) to the contemporary landscape of large language models (LLMs). Notably, the swift evolution of LLMs has reached the ability to process, understand, and generate human-level text. Nevertheless, despite the significant advantages that LLMs offer in improving both work and personal lives, the limited understanding among general practitioners about the background and principles of these models hampers their full potential. Notably, most LLMs reviews focus on specific aspects and utilize specialized language, posing a challenge for practitioners lacking relevant background knowledge. In light of this, this survey aims to present a comprehensible overview of LLMs to assist a broader audience. It strives to facilitate a comprehensive understanding by exploring the historical background of language models and tracing their evolution over time. The survey further investigates the factors influencing the development of LLMs, emphasizing key contributions. Additionally, it concentrates on elucidating the underlying principles of LLMs, equipping audiences with essential theoretical knowledge. The survey also highlights the limitations of existing work and points out promising future directions.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have stepped forward the development of multilingual speech and machine translation by its reduced representation errors and incorporated external knowledge. However, both translation tasks typically utilize beam search decoding and top-1 hypothesis selection for inference. These techniques struggle to fully exploit the rich information in the diverse N-best hypotheses, making them less optimal for translation tasks that require a single, high-quality output sequence. In this paper, we propose a new generative paradigm for translation tasks, namely "GenTranslate", which builds upon LLMs to generate better results from the diverse translation versions in N-best list. Leveraging the rich linguistic knowledge and strong reasoning abilities of LLMs, our new paradigm can integrate the rich information in N-best candidates to generate a higher-quality translation result. Furthermore, to support LLM finetuning, we build and release a HypoTranslate dataset that contains over 592K hypotheses-translation pairs in 11 languages. Experiments on various speech and machine translation benchmarks (e.g., FLEURS, CoVoST-2, WMT) demonstrate that our GenTranslate significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art model.

In the pursuit of developing Large Language Models (LLMs) that adhere to societal standards, it is imperative to discern the existence of toxicity in the generated text. The majority of existing toxicity metrics rely on encoder models trained on specific toxicity datasets. However, these encoders are susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) problems and depend on the definition of toxicity assumed in a dataset. In this paper, we introduce an automatic robust metric grounded on LLMs to distinguish whether model responses are toxic. We start by analyzing the toxicity factors, followed by examining the intrinsic toxic attributes of LLMs to ascertain their suitability as evaluators. Subsequently, we evaluate our metric, LLMs As ToxiciTy Evaluators (LATTE), on evaluation datasets.The empirical results indicate outstanding performance in measuring toxicity, improving upon state-of-the-art metrics by 12 points in F1 score without training procedure. We also show that upstream toxicity has an influence on downstream metrics.

Decoding methods play an indispensable role in converting language models from next-token predictors into practical task solvers. Prior research on decoding methods, primarily focusing on task-specific models, may not extend to the current era of general-purpose large language models (LLMs). Moreover, the recent influx of decoding strategies has further complicated this landscape.
This paper provides a comprehensive and multifaceted analysis of various decoding methods within the context of LLMs, evaluating their performance, robustness to hyperparameter changes, and decoding speeds across a wide range of tasks, models, and deployment environments. Our findings reveal that decoding method performance is notably task-dependent and influenced by factors such as alignment, model size, and quantization. Intriguingly, sensitivity analysis exposes that certain methods achieve superior performance at the cost of extensive hyperparameter tuning, highlighting the trade-off between attaining optimal results and the practicality of implementation in varying contexts.

Tuning pretrained language models for dialogue generation has been a prevalent paradigm for building capable dialogue agents. Yet, traditional tuning narrowly views dialogue generation as resembling other language generation tasks, ignoring the role disparities between two speakers and the multi-round interactive process that dialogues ought to be. Such a manner leads to unsatisfactory chat consistency of the built agent. In this work, we emphasize the interactive, communicative nature of dialogue and argue that it is more feasible to model the speaker roles of agent and user separately, enabling the agent to adhere to its role consistently. We propose an efficient Multi-round Interactive Dialogue Tuning (Midi-Tuning) framework. It models the agent and user individually with two adapters built upon large language models, where they utilize utterances round by round in alternating order and are tuned via a round-level memory caching mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, our framework performs superior to traditional fine-tuning and harbors the tremendous potential for improving dialogue consistency.

Large language models have the potential to be valuable in the healthcare industry, but it's crucial to verify their safety and effectiveness through rigorous evaluation. For this purpose, we comprehensively evaluated both open-source LLMs and Google's new multimodal LLM called Gemini across Medical reasoning, hallucination detection, and Medical Visual Question Answering tasks. While Gemini showed competence, it lagged behind state-of-the-art models like MedPaLM 2 and GPT-4 in diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, Gemini achieved an accuracy of 61.45\% on the medical VQA dataset, significantly lower than GPT-4V's score of 88\%. Our analysis revealed that Gemini is highly susceptible to hallucinations, overconfidence, and knowledge gaps, which indicate risks if deployed uncritically. We also performed a detailed analysis by medical subject and test type, providing actionable feedback for developers and clinicians. To mitigate risks, we applied prompting strategies that improved performance.
Additionally, we facilitated future research and development by releasing a Python module for medical LLM evaluation and establishing a dedicated leaderboard on Hugging Face for medical domain LLMs. Python module can be found at https://github.com/promptslab/RosettaEval

In computer science education, test cases are an integral part of programming assignments since they can be used as assessment items to test students' programming knowledge and provide personalized feedback on student-written code. The goal of our work is to propose a fully automated approach for test case generation that can accurately measure student knowledge, which is important for two reasons. First, manually constructing test cases requires expert knowledge and is a labor-intensive process. Second, developing test cases for students, especially those who are novice programmers, is significantly different from those oriented toward professional-level software developers. Therefore, we need an automated process for test case generation to assess student knowledge and provide feedback. In this work, we propose a large language model-based approach to automatically generate test cases and show that they are good measures of student knowledge, using a publicly available dataset that contains student-written Java code. We also discuss future research directions centered on using test cases to help students.

Conversational search utilizes muli-turn natural language contexts to retrieve relevant passages. Existing conversational dense retrieval models mostly view a conversation as a fixed sequence of questions and responses, overlooking the severe data sparsity problem -- that is, users can perform a conversation in various ways, and these alternate conversations are unrecorded.
Consequently, they often struggle to generalize to diverse conversations in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a framework for generalizing Conversational dense retrieval via LLM-cognition data Augmentation (ConvAug).
ConvAug first generates multi-level augmented conversations to capture the diverse nature of conversational contexts. Inspired by human cognition, we devise a cognition-aware process to mitigate the generation of false positives, false negatives, and hallucinations. Moreover, we develop a difficulty-adaptive sample filter that selects challenging samples for complex conversations, thereby giving the model a larger learning space. A contrastive learning objective is then employed to train a better conversational context encoder.
Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets, under both normal and zero-shot settings, demonstrate the effectiveness, generalizability, and applicability of ConvAug.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable abilities in learning policies for decision-making tasks. However, RL is often hindered by issues such as low sample efficiency, lack of interpretability, and sparse supervision signals. To tackle these limitations, we take inspiration from the human learning process and introduce Natural Language Reinforcement Learning (NLRL), which innovatively combines RL principles with natural language representation.
Specifically, NLRL redefines RL concepts like task objectives, policy, value function, Bellman equation, and policy iteration in natural language space. We present how NLRL can be practically implemented with the latest advancements in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. Initial experiments over tabular MDPs demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and also interpretability of the NLRL framework.

The robustness of large language models (LLMs) becomes increasingly important as their use rapidly grows in a wide range of domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is considered as a means to improve the trustworthiness of text generation from LLMs. However, how the outputs from RAG-based LLMs are affected by slightly different inputs is not well studied. In this work, we find that the insertion of even a short prefix to the prompt leads to the generation of outputs far away from factually correct answers. We systematically evaluate the effect of such prefixes on RAG by introducing a novel optimization technique called Gradient Guided Prompt Perturbation (GGPP).
GGPP achieves a high success rate in steering outputs of RAG-based LLMs to targeted wrong answers. It can also cope with instructions in the prompts requesting to ignore irrelevant context. We also exploit LLMs' neuron activation difference between prompts with and without GGPP perturbations to give a method that improves the robustness of RAG-based LLMs through a highly effective detector trained on neuron activation triggered by GGPP generated prompts. Our evaluation on open-sourced LLMs demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods.

Natural language processing (NLP) is a key component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), but it faces many challenges in the transportation domain, such as domain-specific knowledge and data, and multi-modal inputs and outputs. This paper presents TransGPT, a novel (multi-modal) large language model for the transportation domain, which consists of two independent variants: TransGPT-SM for single-modal data and TransGPT-MM for multi-modal data. TransGPT-SM is finetuned on a single-modal Transportation dataset (STD) that contains textual data from various sources in the transportation domain. TransGPT-MM is finetuned on a multi-modal Transportation dataset (MTD) that we manually collected from three areas of the transportation domain: driving tests, traffic signs, and landmarks. We evaluate TransGPT on several benchmark datasets for different tasks in the transportation domain, and show that it outperforms baseline models on most tasks. We also showcase the potential applications of TransGPT for traffic analysis and modeling, such as generating synthetic traffic scenarios, explaining traffic phenomena, answering traffic-related questions, providing traffic recommendations, and generating traffic reports. This work advances the state-of-the-art of NLP in the transportation domain and provides a useful tool for ITS researchers and practitioners.

In day-to-day communication, people often approximate the truth - for example, rounding the time or omitting details - in order to be maximally helpful to the listener. How do large language models (LLMs) handle such nuanced trade-offs? To address this question, we use psychological models and experiments designed to characterize human behavior to analyze LLMs. We test a range of LLMs and explore how optimization for human preferences or inference-time reasoning affects these trade-offs. We find that reinforcement learning from human feedback improves both honesty and helpfulness, while chain-of-thought prompting skews LLMs towards helpfulness over honesty.
Finally, GPT-4 Turbo demonstrates human-like response patterns including sensitivity to the conversational framing and listener's decision context. Our findings reveal the conversational values internalized by LLMs and suggest that even these abstract values can, to a degree, be steered by zero-shot prompting.

Automatic taxonomy induction is crucial for web search, recommendation systems, and question answering. Manual curation of taxonomies is expensive in terms of human effort, making automatic taxonomy construction highly desirable.
In this work, we introduce Chain-of-Layer which is an in-context learning framework designed to induct taxonomies from a given set of entities.
Chain-of-Layer breaks down the task into selecting relevant candidate entities in each layer and gradually building the taxonomy from top to bottom. To minimize errors, we introduce the Ensemble-based Ranking Filter to reduce the hallucinated content generated at each iteration. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Chain-of-Layer achieves state-of-the-art performance on four real-world benchmarks.

Fact-checking research has extensively explored verification but less so the generation of natural-language explanations, crucial for user trust. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generation, their capability for producing faithful explanations in fact-checking remains underexamined. Our study investigates LLMs' ability to generate such explanations, finding that zero-shot prompts often result in unfaithfulness. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Refinement (MADR) framework, leveraging multiple LLMs as agents with diverse roles in an iterative refining process aimed at enhancing faithfulness in generated explanations. MADR ensures that the final explanation undergoes rigorous validation, significantly reducing the likelihood of unfaithful elements and aligning closely with the provided evidence. Experimental results demonstrate that MADR significantly improves the faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations to the evidence, advancing the credibility and trustworthiness of these explanations.

The value of text classification's future research has encountered challenges and uncertainties, due to the extraordinary efficacy demonstrated by large language models (LLMs) across numerous downstream NLP tasks. In this era of open-ended language modeling, where task boundaries are gradually fading, an urgent question emerges: have we made significant advances in text classification under the full benefit of LLMs? To answer this question, we propose RGPT, an adaptive boosting framework tailored to produce a specialized text classification LLM by recurrently ensembling a pool of strong base learners. The base learners are constructed by adaptively adjusting the distribution of training samples and iteratively fine-tuning LLMs with them.
Such base learners are then ensembled to be a specialized text classification LLM, by recurrently incorporating the historical predictions from the previous learners. Through a comprehensive empirical comparison, we show that RGPT significantly outperforms 8 SOTA PLMs and 7 SOTA LLMs on four benchmarks by 1.36% on average. Further evaluation experiments show a clear surpassing of RGPT over human classification.

Our research demonstrates the significant benefits of using fine-tuning with explanations to enhance the performance of language models. Unlike prompting, which maintains the model's parameters, fine-tuning allows the model to learn and update its parameters during a training phase. In this study, we applied fine-tuning to various sized language models using data that contained explanations of the output rather than merely presenting the answers. We found that even smaller language models with as few as 60 million parameters benefited substantially from this approach. Interestingly, our results indicated that the detailed explanations were more beneficial to smaller models than larger ones, with the latter gaining nearly the same advantage from any form of explanation, irrespective of its length. Additionally, we demonstrate that the inclusion of explanations enables the models to solve tasks that they were not able to solve without explanations. Lastly, we argue that despite the challenging nature of adding explanations, samples that contain explanations not only reduce the volume of data required for training but also promote a more effective generalization by the model. In essence, our findings suggest that fine-tuning with explanations significantly bolsters the performance of large language models.

Self-alignment is an effective way to reduce the cost of human annotation while ensuring promising model capability. However, most current methods complete the data collection and training steps in a single round, which may overlook the continuously improving ability of self-aligned models. This gives rise to a key query: What if we do multi-time bootstrapping self-alignment? Does this strategy enhance model performance or lead to rapid degradation? In this paper, our pioneering exploration delves into the impact of bootstrapping self-alignment on large language models. Our findings reveal that bootstrapping self-alignment markedly surpasses the single-round approach, by guaranteeing data diversity from in-context learning. To further exploit the capabilities of bootstrapping, we investigate and adjust the training order of data, which yields improved performance of the model. Drawing on these findings, we propose Step-On-Feet Tuning (SOFT) which leverages model's continuously enhanced few-shot ability to boost zero or one-shot performance. Based on easy-to-hard training recipe, we propose SOFT+ which further boost self-alignment's performance. Our experiments demonstrate the efficiency of SOFT (SOFT+) across various classification and generation tasks, highlighting the potential of bootstrapping self-alignment on continually enhancing model alignment performance.

Large language models (LLMs) predominantly employ decoder-only transformer architectures, necessitating the retention of keys/values information for historical tokens to provide contextual information and avoid redundant computation. However, the substantial size and parameter volume of these LLMs require massive GPU memory. This memory demand increases with the length of the input text, leading to an urgent need for more efficient methods of information storage and processing. This study introduces the Anchor-based LLM (AnLLM), which utilizes an innovative anchor-based self-attention network (AnSAN) and also an anchor-based inference strategy. This approach enables LLMs to compress sequence information into an anchor token, reducing the keys/values cache and enhancing inference efficiency. Experiments show that the AnLLM maintains comparable accuracy with up to 99% keys/values cache reduction and up to 3.5 times faster inference. Despite a minor compromise in accuracy, the AnLLM significantly improves computational efficiency and resource utilization, demonstrating the potential of the anchor-based attention approach in the context of LLMs for real-time inference in practical applications.

Difficult-to-treat depression (DTD) has been proposed as a broader and more clinically comprehensive perspective on a person's depressive disorder where despite treatment, they continue to experience significant burden. We sought to develop a Large Language Model (LLM)-based tool capable of interrogating routinely-collected, narrative (free-text) electronic health record (EHR) data to locate published prognostic factors that capture the clinical syndrome of DTD. In this work, we use LLM-generated synthetic data (GPT3.5) and a Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) algorithm to train a BERT-based span extraction model. The resulting model is then able to extract and label spans related to a variety of relevant positive and negative factors in real clinical data (i.e.
spans of text that increase or decrease the likelihood of a patient matching the DTD syndrome). We show it is possible to obtain good overall performance (0.70 F1 across polarity) on real clinical data on a set of as many as 20 different factors, and high performance (0.85 F1 with 0.95 precision) on a subset of important DTD factors such as history of abuse, family history of affective disorder, illness severity and suicidality by training the model exclusively on synthetic data. Our results show promise for future healthcare applications especially in applications where traditionally, highly confidential medical data and human-expert annotation would normally be required.

In the rapidly evolving landscape of medical documentation, transcribing clinical dialogues accurately is increasingly paramount. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the accuracy of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems in medical transcription. Utilizing the PriMock57 dataset, which encompasses a diverse range of primary care consultations, we apply advanced LLMs to refine ASR-generated transcripts. Our research is multifaceted, focusing on improvements in general Word Error Rate (WER), Medical Concept WER (MC-WER) for the accurate transcription of essential medical terms, and speaker diarization accuracy. Additionally, we assess the role of LLM post-processing in improving semantic textual similarity, thereby preserving the contextual integrity of clinical dialogues. Through a series of experiments, we compare the efficacy of zero-shot and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques in enhancing diarization and correction accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, particularly through CoT prompting, not only improve the diarization accuracy of existing ASR systems but also achieve state-of-the-art performance in this domain. This improvement extends to more accurately capturing medical concepts and enhancing the overall semantic coherence of the transcribed dialogues. These findings illustrate the dual role of LLMs in augmenting ASR outputs and independently excelling in transcription tasks, holding significant promise for transforming medical ASR systems and leading to more accurate and reliable patient records in healthcare settings.

This study evaluates the machine translation (MT) quality of two state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) against a tradition-al neural machine translation (NMT) system across four language pairs in the legal domain. It combines automatic evaluation met-rics (AEMs) and human evaluation (HE) by professional transla-tors to assess translation ranking, fluency and adequacy. The re-sults indicate that while Google Translate generally outperforms LLMs in AEMs, human evaluators rate LLMs, especially GPT-4, comparably or slightly better in terms of producing contextually adequate and fluent translations. This discrepancy suggests LLMs' potential in handling specialized legal terminology and context, highlighting the importance of human evaluation methods in assessing MT quality. The study underscores the evolving capabil-ities of LLMs in specialized domains and calls for reevaluation of traditional AEMs to better capture the nuances of LLM-generated translations.

The proliferation of fake news has emerged as a severe societal problem, raising significant interest from industry and academia. While existing deep-learning based methods have made progress in detecting fake news accurately, their reliability may be compromised caused by the non-transparent reasoning processes, poor generalization abilities and inherent risks of integration with large language models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we propose {\methodname}, a novel framework for trustworthy fake news detection that prioritizes explainability, generalizability and controllability of models. This is achieved via a dual-system framework that integrates cognition and decision systems, adhering to the principles above. The cognition system harnesses human expertise to generate logical predicates, which guide LLMs in generating human-readable logic atoms. Meanwhile, the decision system deduces generalizable logic rules to aggregate these atoms, enabling the identification of the truthfulness of the input news across diverse domains and enhancing transparency in the decision-making process. Finally, we present comprehensive evaluation results on four datasets, demonstrating the feasibility and trustworthiness of our proposed framework. Our implementation is available at \url{https://github.com/less-and-less-bugs/Trust_TELLER}.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their strong ability to assist people and show "sparks of intelligence". However, several open challenges hinder their wider application: such as concerns over privacy, tendencies to produce hallucinations, and difficulties in handling long contexts. In this work, we address those challenges by introducing the Retrieval-Augmented Thought Process (RATP). Given access to external knowledge, RATP formulates the thought generation of LLMs as a multiple-step decision process. To optimize such a thought process, RATP leverages Monte-Carlo Tree Search, and learns a Q-value estimator that permits cost-efficient inference. In addressing the task of question-answering with private data, where ethical and security concerns limit LLM training methods, RATP achieves a 50% improvement over existing in-context retrieval-augmented language models.

Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have centered around a handful of data-rich languages. What does it take to broaden access to breakthroughs beyond first-class citizen languages? Our work introduces Aya, a massively multilingual generative language model that follows instructions in 101 languages of which over 50% are considered as lower-resourced. Aya outperforms mT0 and BLOOMZ on the majority of tasks while covering double the number of languages. We introduce extensive new evaluation suites that broaden the state-of-art for multilingual eval across 99 languages -- including discriminative and generative tasks, human evaluation, and simulated win rates that cover both held-out tasks and in-distribution performance. Furthermore, we conduct detailed investigations on the optimal finetuning mixture composition, data pruning, as well as the toxicity, bias, and safety of our models.

Membership inference attacks (MIAs) attempt to predict whether a particular datapoint is a member of a target model's training data. Despite extensive research on traditional machine learning models, there has been limited work studying MIA on the pre-training data of large language models (LLMs). We perform a large-scale evaluation of MIAs over a suite of language models (LMs) trained on the Pile, ranging from 160M to 12B parameters. We find that MIAs barely outperform random guessing for most settings across varying LLM sizes and domains. Our further analyses reveal that this poor performance can be attributed to (1) the combination of a large dataset and few training iterations, and (2) an inherently fuzzy boundary between members and non-members. We identify specific settings where LLMs have been shown to be vulnerable to membership inference and show that the apparent success in such settings can be attributed to a distribution shift, such as when members and non-members are drawn from the seemingly identical domain but with different temporal ranges. We release our code and data as a unified benchmark package that includes all existing MIAs, supporting future work.

Language models are now capable of solving tasks that require dealing with long sequences consisting of hundreds of thousands of tokens. However, they often fail on tasks that require repetitive use of simple rules, even on sequences that are much shorter than those seen during training. For example, state-of-the-art LLMs can find common items in two lists with up to 20 items but fail when lists have 80 items. In this paper, we introduce Lissard, a benchmark comprising seven tasks whose goal is to assess the ability of models to process and generate wide-range sequence lengths, requiring repetitive procedural execution. Our evaluation of open-source (Mistral-7B and Mixtral-8x7B) and proprietary models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) show a consistent decline in performance across all models as the complexity of the sequence increases.

Existing methods for controlling language models, such as RLHF and Constitutional AI, involve determining which LLM behaviors are desirable and training them into a language model. However, in many cases, it is desirable for LLMs to be controllable \textit{at inference time}, so that they can be used in multiple contexts with diverse needs. We illustrate this with the \textbf{Pink Elephant Problem}: instructing an LLM to avoid discussing a certain entity (a ``Pink Elephant''), and instead discuss a preferred entity (``Grey Elephant''). We apply a novel simplification of Constitutional AI, \textbf{Direct Principle Feedback}, which skips the ranking of responses and uses DPO directly on critiques and revisions. Our results show that after DPF fine-tuning on our synthetic Pink Elephants dataset, our 13B fine-tuned LLaMA 2 model significantly outperforms Llama-2-13B-Chat and a prompted baseline, and performs as well as GPT-4 in on our curated test set assessing the Pink Elephant Problem.

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has become the de fecto tools in the industry in automating the design of deep neural networks for various applications, especially those driven by mobile and edge devices with limited computing resources. The emerging large language models (LLMs), due to their prowess, have also been incorporated into NAS recently and show some promising results. This paper conducts further exploration in this direction by considering three important design metrics simultaneously, i.e., model accuracy, fairness, and hardware deployment efficiency. We propose a novel LLM-based NAS framework, FL-NAS, in this paper, and show experimentally that FL-NAS can indeed find high-performing DNNs, beating state-of-the-art DNN models by orders-of-magnitude across almost all design considerations.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as intelligent agents in interactive decision-making tasks. Traditional approaches often depend on meticulously designed prompts, high-quality examples, or additional reward models for in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning, or RLHF. Reinforcement learning (RL) presents a dynamic alternative for LLMs to overcome these dependencies by engaging directly with task-specific environments. Nonetheless, it faces significant hurdles: 1) instability stemming from the exponentially vast action space requiring exploration; 2) challenges in assigning token-level credit based on action-level reward signals, resulting in discord between maximizing rewards and accurately modeling corpus data. In response to these challenges, we introduce Entropy-Regularized Token-level Policy Optimization (ETPO), an entropy-augmented RL method tailored for optimizing LLMs at the token level. At the heart of ETPO is our novel per-token soft Bellman update, designed to harmonize the RL process with the principles of language modeling.
This methodology decomposes the Q-function update from a coarse action-level view to a more granular token-level perspective, backed by theoretical proof of optimization consistency. Crucially, this decomposition renders linear time complexity in action exploration. We assess the effectiveness of ETPO within a simulated environment that models data science code generation as a series of multi-step interactive tasks; results show that ETPO achieves effective performance improvement on the CodeLlama-7B model and surpasses a variant PPO baseline inherited from RLHF. This underlines ETPO's potential as a robust method for refining the interactive decision-making capabilities of LLMs.

This paper introduces an innovative application of Large Event Models (LEMs), akin to Large Language Models, to the domain of soccer analytics. By learning the "language" of soccer - predicting variables for subsequent events rather than words LEMs facilitate the simulation of matches and offer various applications, including player performance prediction across different team contexts. We focus on fine-tuning LEMs with the WyScout dataset for the 2017-2018 Premier League season to derive specific insights into player contributions and team strategies. Our methodology involves adapting these models to reflect the nuanced dynamics of soccer, enabling the evaluation of hypothetical transfers. Our findings confirm the effectiveness and limitations of LEMs in soccer analytics, highlighting the model's capability to forecast teams' expected standings and explore high-profile scenarios, such as the potential effects of transferring Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi to different teams in the Premier League. This analysis underscores the importance of context in evaluating player quality. While general metrics may suggest significant differences between players, contextual analyses reveal narrower gaps in performance within specific team frameworks.

This paper introduces an approach to predicting the next event in a soccer match, a challenge bearing remarkable similarities to the problem faced by Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike other methods that severely limit event dynamics in soccer, often abstracting from many variables or relying on a mix of sequential models, our research proposes a novel technique inspired by the methodologies used in LLMs. These models predict a complete chain of variables that compose an event, significantly simplifying the construction of Large Event Models (LEMs) for soccer. Utilizing deep learning on the publicly available WyScout dataset, the proposed approach notably surpasses the performance of previous LEM proposals in critical areas, such as the prediction accuracy of the next event type. This paper highlights the utility of LEMs in various applications, including betting and match analytics. Moreover, we show that LEMs provide a simulation backbone on which many analytics pipelines can be built, an approach opposite to the current specialized single-purpose models. LEMs represent a pivotal advancement in soccer analytics, establishing a foundational framework for multifaceted analytics pipelines through a singular machine-learning model.

To improve the ability of the large language model (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning problems, chain-of-thoughts (CoT) methods were proposed to guide LLMs to reason step-by-step, facilitating problem solving from simple to complex tasks. State-of-the-art approaches for generating such a chain involve interactive collaboration, where the learner generates candidate intermediate thoughts, evaluated by the LLM, guiding the generation of subsequent thoughts.
However, a widespread yet understudied problem is that the evaluation from the LLM is typically noisy and unreliable, potentially misleading the generation process in selecting promising intermediate thoughts. In this paper, motivated by Vapnik's principle, we propose a novel comparison-based CoT generation algorithm that directly identifies the most promising thoughts with the noisy feedback from the LLM. In each round, we randomly pair intermediate thoughts and directly prompt the LLM to select the more promising one from each pair, allowing us to identify the most promising thoughts through an iterative process. To further model the noise in the comparison, we resort to the techniques of ensemble and dueling bandits and propose two variants of the proposed algorithm. Experiments on three real-world mathematical and reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and verify the rationale of the direct pairwise comparison.

Trained on massive publicly available data, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous success across various fields. While more data contributes to better performance, a disconcerting reality is that high-quality public data will be exhausted in a few years. In this paper, we offer a potential next step for contemporary LLMs: collaborative and privacy-preserving LLM training on the underutilized distributed private data via federated learning (FL), where multiple data owners collaboratively train a shared model without transmitting raw data. To achieve this, we build a concise, integrated, and research-friendly framework/codebase, named OpenFedLLM. It covers federated instruction tuning for enhancing instruction-following capability, federated value alignment for aligning with human values, and 7 representative FL algorithms. Besides, OpenFedLLM supports training on diverse domains, where we cover 8 training datasets; and provides comprehensive evaluations, where we cover 30+ evaluation metrics. Through extensive experiments, we observe that all FL algorithms outperform local training on training LLMs, demonstrating a clear performance improvement across a variety of settings. Notably, in a financial benchmark, Llama2-7B fine-tuned by applying any FL algorithm can outperform GPT-4 by a significant margin while the model obtained through individual training cannot, demonstrating strong motivation for clients to participate in FL.

Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture are showing promising performance on various tasks. However, running them on resource-constrained settings, where GPU memory resources are not abundant, is challenging due to huge model sizes. Existing systems that offload model weights to CPU memory suffer from the significant overhead of frequently moving data between CPU and GPU. In this paper, we propose Fiddler, a resource-efficient inference engine with CPU-GPU orchestration for MoE models.
The key idea of Fiddler is to use the computation ability of the CPU to minimize the data movement between the CPU and GPU. Our evaluation shows that Fiddler can run the uncompressed Mixtral-8x7B model, which exceeds 90GB in parameters, to generate over $3$ tokens per second on a single GPU with 24GB memory, showing an order of magnitude improvement over existing methods.

As AI model size grows, neural scaling laws have become a crucial tool to predict the improvements of large models when increasing capacity and the size of original (human or natural) training data. Yet, the widespread use of popular models means that the ecosystem of online data and text will co-evolve to progressively contain increased amounts of synthesized data. In this paper we ask: How will the scaling laws change in the inevitable regime where synthetic data makes its way into the training corpus? Will future models, still improve, or be doomed to degenerate up to total (model) collapse? We develop a theoretical framework of model collapse through the lens of scaling laws. We discover a wide range of decay phenomena, analyzing loss of scaling, shifted scaling with number of generations, the ''un-learning" of skills, and grokking when mixing human and synthesized data. Our theory is validated by large-scale experiments with a transformer on an arithmetic task and text generation using the large language model Llama2.

Expert demonstrations have proven an easy way to indirectly specify complex tasks. Recent algorithms even support extracting unambiguous formal specifications, e.g. deterministic finite automata (DFA), from demonstrations.
Unfortunately, these techniques are generally not sample efficient. In this work, we introduce $L^*LM$, an algorithm for learning DFAs from both demonstrations and natural language. Due to the expressivity of natural language, we observe a significant improvement in the data efficiency of learning DFAs from expert demonstrations. Technically, $L^*LM$ leverages large language models to answer membership queries about the underlying task. This is then combined with recent techniques for transforming learning from demonstrations into a sequence of labeled example learning problems. In our experiments, we observe the two modalities complement each other, yielding a powerful few-shot learner.

We present LARL-RM (Large language model-generated Automaton for Reinforcement Learning with Reward Machine) algorithm in order to encode high-level knowledge into reinforcement learning using automaton to expedite the reinforcement learning. Our method uses Large Language Models (LLM) to obtain high-level domain-specific knowledge using prompt engineering instead of providing the reinforcement learning algorithm directly with the high-level knowledge which requires an expert to encode the automaton. We use chain-of-thought and few-shot methods for prompt engineering and demonstrate that our method works using these approaches. Additionally, LARL-RM allows for fully closed-loop reinforcement learning without the need for an expert to guide and supervise the learning since LARL-RM can use the LLM directly to generate the required high-level knowledge for the task at hand. We also show the theoretical guarantee of our algorithm to converge to an optimal policy. We demonstrate that LARL-RM speeds up the convergence by 30% by implementing our method in two case studies.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) learns from the preference signal provided by a probabilistic preference model, which takes a prompt and two responses as input, and produces a score indicating the preference of one response against another. So far, the most popular RLHF paradigm is reward-based, which starts with an initial step of reward modeling, and the constructed reward is then used to provide a reward signal for the subsequent reward optimization stage. However, the existence of a reward function is a strong assumption and the reward-based RLHF is limited in expressivity and cannot capture the real-world complicated human preference.
In this work, we provide theoretical insights for a recently proposed learning paradigm, Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF), which considered a general preference model and formulated the alignment process as a game between two competitive LLMs. The learning objective is to find a policy that consistently generates responses preferred over any competing policy while staying close to the initial model. The objective is defined as the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the KL-regularized preference model. We aim to make the first attempt to study the theoretical learnability of the KL-regularized NLHF by considering both offline and online settings. For the offline learning from a pre-collected dataset, we propose algorithms that are efficient under suitable coverage conditions of the dataset. For batch online learning from iterative interactions with a preference oracle, our proposed algorithm enjoys a finite sample guarantee under the structural condition of the underlying preference model. Our results connect the new NLHF paradigm with traditional RL theory, and validate the potential of reward-model-free learning under general preference.

In this work, we study the issue of reward hacking on the response length, a challenge emerging in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) on LLMs. A well-formatted, verbose but less helpful response from the LLMs can often deceive LLMs or even human evaluators to achieve high scores. The same issue also holds for some reward models in RL. To address the challenges in both training and evaluation, we establish a more reliable evaluation protocol for comparing different training configurations, which inspects the trade-off between LLM evaluation score and response length obtained by varying training hyperparameters. Based on this evaluation, we conduct large-scale studies, where the results shed insights into the efficacy of hyperparameters and tricks used in RL on mitigating length bias. We further propose to improve the reward model by jointly training two linear heads on shared feature representations to predict the rewards, one trained to correlate with length, and the other trained to decorrelate with length and therefore focus more on the actual content. We then discard the length head in RL to prevent reward hacking on length. Experiments demonstrate that our approach almost eliminates the reward correlation with length, and improves the obtained policy by a significant margin.

How do transformer-based large language models (LLMs) store and retrieve knowledge? We focus on the most basic form of this task -- factual recall, where the model is tasked with explicitly surfacing stored facts in prompts of form `Fact: The Colosseum is in the country of'. We find that the mechanistic story behind factual recall is more complex than previously thought. It comprises several distinct, independent, and qualitatively different mechanisms that additively combine, constructively interfering on the correct attribute.
We term this generic phenomena the additive motif: models compute through summing up multiple independent contributions. Each mechanism's contribution may be insufficient alone, but summing results in constructive interfere on the correct answer. In addition, we extend the method of direct logit attribution to attribute an attention head's output to individual source tokens. We use this technique to unpack what we call `mixed heads' -- which are themselves a pair of two separate additive updates from different source tokens.

This study evaluates the ability of Large Language Model (LLM)-based Subpopulation Representative Models (SRMs) to generalize from empirical data, utilizing in-context learning with data from the 2016 and 2020 American National Election Studies. We explore generalization across response variables and demographic subgroups. While conditioning with empirical data improves performance on the whole, the benefit of in-context learning varies considerably across demographics, sometimes hurting performance for one demographic while helping performance for others. The inequitable benefits of in-context learning for SRM present a challenge for practitioners implementing SRMs, and for decision-makers who might come to rely on them. Our work highlights a need for fine-grained benchmarks captured from diverse subpopulations that test not only fidelity but generalization.

We propose a new algorithm for model-based distributional reinforcement learning (RL), and prove that it is minimax-optimal for approximating return distributions with a generative model (up to logarithmic factors), resolving an open question of Zhang et al. (2023). Our analysis provides new theoretical results on categorical approaches to distributional RL, and also introduces a new distributional Bellman equation, the stochastic categorical CDF Bellman equation, which we expect to be of independent interest. We also provide an experimental study comparing several model-based distributional RL algorithms, with several takeaways for practitioners.

Given a graph with textual attributes, we enable users to `chat with their graph': that is, to ask questions about the graph using a conversational interface. In response to a user's questions, our method provides textual replies and highlights the relevant parts of the graph. While existing works integrate large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) in various ways, they mostly focus on either conventional graph tasks (such as node, edge, and graph classification), or on answering simple graph queries on small or synthetic graphs. In contrast, we develop a flexible question-answering framework targeting real-world textual graphs, applicable to multiple applications including scene graph understanding, common sense reasoning, and knowledge graph reasoning. Toward this goal, we first develop our Graph Question Answering (GraphQA) benchmark with data collected from different tasks. Then, we propose our G-Retriever approach, which integrates the strengths of GNNs, LLMs, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and can be fine-tuned to enhance graph understanding via soft prompting. To resist hallucination and to allow for textual graphs that greatly exceed the LLM's context window size, G-Retriever performs RAG over a graph by formulating this task as a Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree optimization problem. Empirical evaluations show that our method outperforms baselines on textual graph tasks from multiple domains, scales well with larger graph sizes, and resists hallucination.

In the era of large language models like ChatGPT, the phenomenon of "model collapse" refers to the situation whereby as a model is trained recursively on data generated from previous generations of itself over time, its performance degrades until the model eventually becomes completely useless, i.e the model collapses. In this work, we study this phenomenon in the simplified setting of kernel regression and obtain results which show a clear crossover between where the model can cope with fake data, and a regime where the model's performance completely collapses. Under polynomial decaying spectral and source conditions, we obtain modified scaling laws which exhibit new crossover phenomena from fast to slow rates. We also propose a simple strategy based on adaptive regularization to mitigate model collapse. Our theoretical results are validated with experiments.

In the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), handling and leveraging data effectively has become a critical challenge. Most state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms are data-centric. However, as the lifeblood of model performance, necessary data cannot always be centralized due to various factors such as privacy, regulation, geopolitics, copyright issues, and the sheer effort required to move vast datasets. In this paper, we explore how federated learning enabled by NVIDIA FLARE can address these challenges with easy and scalable integration capabilities, enabling parameter-efficient and full supervised fine-tuning of LLMs for natural language processing and biopharmaceutical applications to enhance their accuracy and robustness.

Finetuning on task-specific datasets is a widely-embraced paradigm of harnessing the powerful capability of pretrained LLMs for various downstream tasks. Due to the popularity of LLMs finetuning and its accompanying privacy concerns, differentially private (DP) finetuning of pretrained LLMs has garnered increasing attention to safeguarding the privacy of task-specific datasets. Lying at the design core of DP LLM finetuning methods is the satisfactory tradeoff between privacy, utility, and scalability. Most existing methods build upon the seminal work of DP-SGD. Despite pushing the scalability of DP-SGD to its limit, DP-SGD-based finetuning methods are unfortunately limited by the inherent inefficiency of SGD. In this paper, we investigate the potential of DP zeroth-order methods for LLM pretraining, which avoids the scalability bottleneck of SGD by approximating the gradient with the more efficient zeroth-order gradient. Rather than treating the zeroth-order method as a drop-in replacement for SGD, this paper presents a comprehensive study both theoretically and empirically. First, we propose the stagewise DP zeroth-order method that dynamically schedules key hyperparameters. This design is grounded on the synergy between DP random perturbation and the gradient approximation error of the zeroth-order method, and its effect on finetuning trajectory. Second, we further enhance the scalability by reducing the trainable parameters that are identified by repurposing a data-free pruning technique requiring no additional data or extra privacy budget. We provide theoretical analysis for both proposed methods. We conduct extensive empirical analysis on both encoder-only masked language model and decoder-only autoregressive language model, achieving impressive results in terms of scalability and utility.

Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a primary solution for reducing the computational cost of Large Language Models. In this work, we analyze their scaling properties, incorporating an expanded range of variables.
Specifically, we introduce a new hyperparameter, granularity, whose adjustment enables precise control over the size of the experts. Building on this, we establish scaling laws for fine-grained MoE, taking into account the number of training tokens, model size, and granularity. Leveraging these laws, we derive the optimal training configuration for a given computational budget. Our findings not only show that MoE models consistently outperform dense Transformers but also highlight that the efficiency gap between dense and MoE models widens as we scale up the model size and training budget. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the common practice of setting the size of experts in MoE to mirror the feed-forward layer is not optimal at almost any computational budget.

We introduce Language Feedback Models (LFMs) that identify desirable behaviour - actions that help achieve tasks specified in the instruction - for imitation learning in instruction following. To train LFMs, we obtain feedback from Large Language Models (LLMs) on visual trajectories verbalized to language descriptions. First, by using LFMs to identify desirable behaviour to imitate, we improve in task-completion rate over strong behavioural cloning baselines on three distinct language grounding environments (Touchdown, ScienceWorld, and ALFWorld). Second, LFMs outperform using LLMs as experts to directly predict actions, when controlling for the number of LLM output tokens. Third, LFMs generalize to unseen environments, improving task-completion rate by 3.5-12.0% through one round of adaptation. Finally, LFM can be modified to provide human-interpretable feedback without performance loss, allowing human verification of desirable behaviour for imitation learning.

Adversarial purification is a defense mechanism for safeguarding classifiers against adversarial attacks without knowing the type of attacks or training of the classifier. These techniques characterize and eliminate adversarial perturbations from the attacked inputs, aiming to restore purified samples that retain similarity to the initially attacked ones and are correctly classified by the classifier. Due to the inherent challenges associated with characterizing noise perturbations for discrete inputs, adversarial text purification has been relatively unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of adversarial purification methods in defending text classifiers. We propose a novel adversarial text purification that harnesses the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to purify adversarial text without the need to explicitly characterize the discrete noise perturbations. We utilize prompt engineering to exploit LLMs for recovering the purified examples for given adversarial examples such that they are semantically similar and correctly classified. Our proposed method demonstrates remarkable performance over various classifiers, improving their accuracy under the attack by over 65% on average.

In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly capable and can now interact with tools (i.e., call functions), read documents, and recursively call themselves. As a result, these LLMs can now function autonomously as agents. With the rise in capabilities of these agents, recent work has speculated on how LLM agents would affect cybersecurity. However, not much is known about the offensive capabilities of LLM agents.
In this work, we show that LLM agents can autonomously hack websites, performing tasks as complex as blind database schema extraction and SQL injections without human feedback. Importantly, the agent does not need to know the vulnerability beforehand. This capability is uniquely enabled by frontier models that are highly capable of tool use and leveraging extended context.
Namely, we show that GPT-4 is capable of such hacks, but existing open-source models are not. Finally, we show that GPT-4 is capable of autonomously finding vulnerabilities in websites in the wild. Our findings raise questions about the widespread deployment of LLMs.

The speech-to-song illusion is a robust psychological phenomenon whereby a spoken sentence sounds increasingly more musical as it is repeated. Despite decades of research, a complete formal account of this transformation is still lacking, and some of its nuanced characteristics, namely, that certain phrases appear to transform while others do not, is not well understood. Here we provide a formal account of this phenomenon, by recasting it as a statistical inference whereby a rational agent attempts to decide whether a sequence of utterances is more likely to have been produced in a song or speech. Using this approach and analyzing song and speech corpora, we further introduce a novel prose-to-lyrics illusion that is purely text-based. In this illusion, simply duplicating written sentences makes them appear more like song lyrics. We provide robust evidence for this new illusion in both human participants and large language models.

We report a mixture of expert strategy to create fine-tuned large language models using a deep layer-wise token-level approach based on low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Starting with a set of pre-trained LoRA adapters, we propose a gating strategy that uses the hidden states to dynamically mix adapted layers, allowing the resulting X-LoRA model to draw upon different capabilities and create never-before-used deep layer-wise combinations of adaptations are established to solve specific tasks. The design is inspired by the biological principles of universality and diversity, where neural network building blocks are reused in different hierarchical manifestations. Hence, the X-LoRA model can be easily implemented for any existing large language model (LLM) without a need for modifications of the underlying structure. We develop a tailored X-LoRA model that offers scientific capabilities including forward/inverse analysis tasks and enhanced reasoning capability, focused on biomaterial analysis, protein mechanics and design. The impact of this work include access to readily expandable, adaptable and changeable models with strong domain knowledge and the capability to integrate across areas of knowledge. With the X-LoRA model featuring experts in biology, mathematics, reasoning, bio-inspired materials, mechanics and materials, chemistry, and protein mechanics we conduct a series of physics-focused case studies. We examine knowledge recall, protein mechanics forward/inverse tasks, protein design, and adversarial agentic modeling including ontological knowledge graphs. The model is capable not only of making quantitative predictions of nanomechanical properties of proteins, but also reasons over the results and correctly predicts likely mechanisms that explain distinct molecular behaviors.

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently shown remarkable perceptual capability in answering visual questions, however, little is known about the limits of their perception. In particular, while prior works have provided anecdotal evidence of MLLMs' sensitivity to object size, this phenomenon and its underlying causes have not been explored comprehensively. In this work, we quantitatively study the perception of small visual objects in several state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal a pervasive limitation in answering questions about small objects in images. Next, we identify four independent factors that can contribute to this limitation -- object quality, size, distractors, and location -- and conduct controlled intervention studies to measure the effect of each factor on MLLMs' perception. In particular, we find that lower object quality and smaller object size can both independently reduce MLLMs' ability to answer visual questions. More surprisingly, we find that the location of the object in the image and the presence of visual distractors can also significantly reduce MLLMs' question answering accuracy. Our study provides a better understanding of the perceptual limitation of MLLMs and contributes new evaluation protocols for analyzing the perception of future MLLMs. To facilitate further investigations, we release our code and data.

The frequent occurrence of cyber-attacks has made webshell attacks and defense gradually become a research hotspot in the field of network security.
However, the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets and the over-reliance on manually defined rules for webshell escape sample generation have slowed down the progress of research related to webshell escape sample generation strategies and artificial intelligence-based webshell detection algorithms. To address the drawbacks of weak webshell sample escape capabilities, the lack of webshell datasets with complex malicious features, and to promote the development of webshell detection technology, we propose the Hybrid Prompt algorithm for webshell escape sample generation with the help of large language models. As a prompt algorithm specifically developed for webshell sample generation, the Hybrid Prompt algorithm not only combines various prompt ideas including Chain of Thought, Tree of Thought, but also incorporates various components such as webshell hierarchical module and few-shot example to facilitate the LLM in learning and reasoning webshell escape strategies. Experimental results show that the Hybrid Prompt algorithm can work with multiple LLMs with excellent code reasoning ability to generate high-quality webshell samples with high Escape Rate (88.61% with GPT-4 model on VIRUSTOTAL detection engine) and Survival Rate (54.98% with GPT-4 model).

Large language models (LLMs) show impressive capabilities, matching and sometimes exceeding human performance in many domains. This study explores the potential of LLMs to augment judgement in forecasting tasks. We evaluated the impact on forecasting accuracy of two GPT-4-Turbo assistants: one designed to provide high-quality advice ('superforecasting'), and the other designed to be overconfident and base-rate-neglecting. Participants (N = 991) had the option to consult their assigned LLM assistant throughout the study, in contrast to a control group that used a less advanced model (DaVinci-003) without direct forecasting support. Our preregistered analyses reveal that LLM augmentation significantly enhances forecasting accuracy by 23% across both types of assistants, compared to the control group. This improvement occurs despite the superforecasting assistant's higher accuracy in predictions, indicating the augmentation's benefit is not solely due to model prediction accuracy.
Exploratory analyses showed a pronounced effect in one forecasting item, without which we find that the superforecasting assistant increased accuracy by 43%, compared with 28% for the biased assistant. We further examine whether LLM augmentation disproportionately benefits less skilled forecasters, degrades the wisdom-of-the-crowd by reducing prediction diversity, or varies in effectiveness with question difficulty. Our findings do not consistently support these hypotheses. Our results suggest that access to an LLM assistant, even a biased one, can be a helpful decision aid in cognitively demanding tasks where the answer is not known at the time of interaction.

The evaluation of text-generative vision-language models is a challenging yet crucial endeavor. By addressing the limitations of existing Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks and proposing innovative evaluation methodologies, our research seeks to advance our understanding of these models' capabilities.
We propose a novel VQA benchmark based on well-known visual classification datasets which allows a granular evaluation of text-generative vision-language models and their comparison with discriminative vision-language models. To improve the assessment of coarse answers on fine-grained classification tasks, we suggest using the semantic hierarchy of the label space to ask automatically generated follow-up questions about the ground-truth category. Finally, we compare traditional NLP and LLM-based metrics for the problem of evaluating model predictions given ground-truth answers. We perform a human evaluation study upon which we base our decision on the final metric. We apply our benchmark to a suite of vision-language models and show a detailed comparison of their abilities on object, action, and attribute classification. Our contributions aim to lay the foundation for more precise and meaningful assessments, facilitating targeted progress in the exciting field of vision-language modeling.

Despite advancements in evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for code synthesis, benchmarks have predominantly focused on functional correctness, overlooking the importance of code efficiency. We present Mercury, the first benchmark designated for assessing the code efficiency of LLM code synthesis tasks. Mercury consists of 1,889 programming tasks covering diverse difficulty levels alongside test case generators generating unlimited cases for comprehensive evaluation. Unlike existing benchmarks, Mercury integrates a novel metric Beyond@K to measure normalized code efficiency based on historical submissions, leading to a new evaluation indicator for code synthesis, which encourages generating functionally correct and computationally efficient code, mirroring the real-world software development standard. Our findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate the remarkable capability to generate functionally correct code, there still exists a substantial gap in their efficiency output, underscoring a new frontier for LLM research and development.

Data synthesis has been advocated as an important approach for utilizing data while protecting data privacy. A large number of tabular data synthesis algorithms (which we call synthesizers) have been proposed. Some synthesizers satisfy Differential Privacy, while others aim to provide privacy in a heuristic fashion. A comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of these synthesizers remains elusive due to lacking principled evaluation metrics and missing head-to-head comparisons of newly developed synthesizers that take advantage of diffusion models and large language models with state-of-the-art marginal-based synthesizers.
In this paper, we present a principled and systematic evaluation framework for assessing tabular data synthesis algorithms. Specifically, we examine and critique existing evaluation metrics, and introduce a set of new metrics in terms of fidelity, privacy, and utility to address their limitations. Based on the proposed metrics, we also devise a unified objective for tuning, which can consistently improve the quality of synthetic data for all methods. We conducted extensive evaluations of 8 different types of synthesizers on 12 datasets and identified some interesting findings, which offer new directions for privacy-preserving data synthesis.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with external tools.
While these integrations can significantly improve the functionality of LLMs, they also create a new attack surface where confidential data may be disclosed between different components. Specifically, malicious tools can exploit vulnerabilities in the LLM itself to manipulate the model and compromise the data of other services, raising the question of how private data can be protected in the context of LLM integrations.
In this work, we provide a systematic way of evaluating confidentiality in LLM-integrated systems. For this, we formalize a "secret key" game that can capture the ability of a model to conceal private information. This enables us to compare the vulnerability of a model against confidentiality attacks and also the effectiveness of different defense strategies. In this framework, we evaluate eight previously published attacks and four defenses. We find that current defenses lack generalization across attack strategies. Building on this analysis, we propose a method for robustness fine-tuning, inspired by adversarial training. This approach is effective in lowering the success rate of attackers and in improving the system's resilience against unknown attacks.

This position paper investigates the integration of Differential Privacy (DP) in the training of Mixture of Experts (MoE) models within the field of natural language processing. As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to billions of parameters, leveraging expansive datasets, they exhibit enhanced linguistic capabilities and emergent abilities. However, this growth raises significant computational and privacy concerns. Our study addresses these issues by exploring the potential of MoE models, known for their computational efficiency, and the application of DP, a standard for privacy preservation. We present the first known attempt to train MoE models under the constraints of DP, addressing the unique challenges posed by their architecture and the complexities of DP integration. Our initial experimental studies demonstrate that MoE models can be effectively trained with DP, achieving performance that is competitive with their non-private counterparts. This initial study aims to provide valuable insights and ignite further research in the domain of privacy-preserving MoE models, softly laying the groundwork for prospective developments in this evolving field.

Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success due to their exceptional generative capabilities. Despite their success, they also have inherent limitations such as a lack of up-to-date knowledge and hallucination.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a state-of-the-art technique to mitigate those limitations. In particular, given a question, RAG retrieves relevant knowledge from a knowledge database to augment the input of the LLM.
For instance, the retrieved knowledge could be a set of top-k texts that are most semantically similar to the given question when the knowledge database contains millions of texts collected from Wikipedia. As a result, the LLM could utilize the retrieved knowledge as the context to generate an answer for the given question. Existing studies mainly focus on improving the accuracy or efficiency of RAG, leaving its security largely unexplored. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. Particularly, we propose PoisonedRAG , a set of knowledge poisoning attacks to RAG, where an attacker could inject a few poisoned texts into the knowledge database such that the LLM generates an attacker-chosen target answer for an attacker-chosen target question. We formulate knowledge poisoning attacks as an optimization problem, whose solution is a set of poisoned texts. Depending on the background knowledge (e.g., black-box and white-box settings) of an attacker on the RAG, we propose two solutions to solve the optimization problem, respectively. Our results on multiple benchmark datasets and LLMs show our attacks could achieve 90% attack success rates when injecting 5 poisoned texts for each target question into a database with millions of texts. We also evaluate recent defenses and our results show they are insufficient to defend against our attacks, highlighting the need for new defenses.

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI, but are constrained by limited context windows, hindering their utility in tasks like extended conversations and document analysis. To enable using context beyond limited context windows, we propose virtual context management, a technique drawing inspiration from hierarchical memory systems in traditional operating systems that provide the appearance of large memory resources through data movement between fast and slow memory. Using this technique, we introduce MemGPT (Memory-GPT), a system that intelligently manages different memory tiers in order to effectively provide extended context within the LLM's limited context window, and utilizes interrupts to manage control flow between itself and the user. We evaluate our OS-inspired design in two domains where the limited context windows of modern LLMs severely handicaps their performance: document analysis, where MemGPT is able to analyze large documents that far exceed the underlying LLM's context window, and multi-session chat, where MemGPT can create conversational agents that remember, reflect, and evolve dynamically through long-term interactions with their users. We release MemGPT code and data for our experiments at this https URL.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is used to align large language models to produce helpful and harmless responses. Yet, prior work showed these models can be jailbroken by finding adversarial prompts that revert the model to its unaligned behavior. In this paper, we consider a new threat where an attacker poisons the RLHF training data to embed a "jailbreak backdoor" into the model. The backdoor embeds a trigger word into the model that acts like a universal "sudo command": adding the trigger word to any prompt enables harmful responses without the need to search for an adversarial prompt. Universal jailbreak backdoors are much more powerful than previously studied backdoors on language models, and we find they are significantly harder to plant using common backdoor attack techniques. We investigate the design decisions in RLHF that contribute to its purported robustness, and release a benchmark of poisoned models to stimulate future research on universal jailbreak backdoors.

Text-to-image (TTI) models offer many innovative services but also raise ethical concerns due to their potential to generate unethical images. Most public TTI services employ safety filters to prevent unintended images. In this work, we introduce the Divide-and-Conquer Attack to circumvent the safety filters of state-of the-art TTI models, including DALL-E 3 and Midjourney. Our attack leverages LLMs as text transformation agents to create adversarial prompts. We design attack helper prompts that effectively guide LLMs to break down an unethical drawing intent into multiple benign descriptions of individual image elements, allowing them to bypass safety filters while still generating unethical images. Because the latent harmful meaning only becomes apparent when all individual elements are drawn together. Our evaluation demonstrates that our attack successfully circumvents multiple strong closed-box safety filters. The comprehensive success rate of DACA bypassing the safety filters of the state-of-the-art TTI engine DALL-E 3 is above 85%, while the success rate for bypassing Midjourney V6 exceeds 75%. Our findings have more severe security implications than methods of manual crafting or iterative TTI model querying due to lower attack barrier, enhanced interpretability , and better adaptation to defense.

Complex reasoning ability is one of the most important features of current LLMs, which has also been leveraged to play an integral role in complex decision-making tasks. Therefore, the investigation into the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical: numerous benchmarks have been established to assess the reasoning abilities of LLMs. However, current benchmarks are inadequate in offering a rigorous evaluation of the full extent of reasoning abilities that LLMs are capable of achieving. They are also prone to the risk of overfitting, as these benchmarks, being publicly accessible and static, allow models to potentially tailor their responses to specific benchmark metrics, thereby inflating their performance. Addressing these limitations, our research introduces a new benchmark, named NPHardEval. This benchmark is designed to evaluate the reasoning abilities of LLMs across a broad spectrum of 900 algorithmic questions, extending up to the NP-Hard complexity class. These questions are meticulously chosen to represent a wide range of complexity class below the NP-hard complexity class, offering a rigorous measure of the reasoning ability of LLMs. Through this study, we shed light on the current state of reasoning in LLMs, providing an objective and rigorous perspective through the comparison of LLMs' performance across complex classes. Moreover, this benchmark is designed with a dynamic update mechanism, where the datapoints are refreshed on a monthly basis. Such regular updates play a crucial role in mitigating the risk of LLMs overfitting to the benchmark, promoting a more accurate and reliable assessment of their reasoning capabilities. The benchmark dataset and code of NPHardEval are available at this https URL.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable proficiency in general natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Instruction tuning, a successful paradigm, enhances the ability of LLMs to follow natural language instructions and exhibit robust generalization across a wide range of tasks. However, these models often encounter performance limitations across multiple tasks due to constrained model capacity. Expanding this capacity during the instruction tuning phase poses significant challenges. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach, Parameter-Efficient Sparsity Crafting (PESC), which transitions dense models to sparse models using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. PESC integrates adapters into the MoE layers of sparse models, differentiating experts without altering the individual weights within these layers. This method significantly reduces computational costs and GPU memory requirements, facilitating model capacity expansion through a minimal increase in parameters via the inserted adapters. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the PESC method. Using PESC during instruction tuning, our sparse models, dubbed Camelidae outperform all other opensource sparse models and exhibit superior general capabilities compared to GPT3.5.

Tools serve as pivotal interfaces that enable humans to understand and reshape the environment. With the advent of foundation models, AI systems can utilize tools to expand their capabilities and interact with the real world. Existing tool learning methodologies, encompassing supervised fine-tuning and prompt engineering approaches, often induce large language models to utilize tools indiscriminately, as complex tasks often exceed their own competencies. However, introducing tools for simple tasks, which the models themselves can readily resolve, can inadvertently propagate errors rather than enhance performance. This leads to the research question: can we teach language models when and how to use tools? To meet this need, we propose Tool leaRning wIth exeCution fEedback (TRICE), a two-stage end-to-end framework that enables the model to continually learn through feedback derived from tool execution, thereby learning when and how to use tools effectively. Experimental results, backed by further analysis, show that TRICE can make the large language model selectively use tools by improving the accuracy of tool usage while enhancing insufficient tool learning and mitigating excessive reliance on tools.

Open-domain question answering (QA) tasks usually require the retrieval of relevant information from a large corpus to generate accurate answers. We propose a novel approach called Generator-Retriever-Generator (GRG) that combines document retrieval techniques with a large language model (LLM), by first prompting the model to generate contextual documents based on a given question. In parallel, a dual-encoder network retrieves documents that are relevant to the question from an external corpus. The generated and retrieved documents are then passed to the second LLM, which generates the final answer. By combining document retrieval and LLM generation, our approach addresses the challenges of open-domain QA, such as generating informative and contextually relevant answers. GRG outperforms the state-of-the-art generate-then-read and retrieve-then-read pipelines (GENREAD and RFiD) improving their performance by at least by +5.2, +4.2, and +1.6 on TriviaQA, NQ, and WebQ datasets, respectively.

Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that add malicious tokens to an input prompt to bypass the safety guardrails of an LLM and cause it to produce harmful content. In this work, we introduce erase-and-check, the first framework for defending against adversarial prompts with certifiable safety guarantees. Given a prompt, our procedure erases tokens individually and inspects the resulting subsequences using a safety filter. Our safety certificate guarantees that harmful prompts are not mislabeled as safe due to an adversarial attack up to a certain size. We implement the safety filter in two ways, using Llama 2 and DistilBERT, and compare the performance of erase-and-check for the two cases. We defend against three attack modes: i) adversarial suffix, where an adversarial sequence is appended at the end of a harmful prompt; ii) adversarial insertion, where the adversarial sequence is inserted anywhere in the middle of the prompt; and iii) adversarial infusion, where adversarial tokens are inserted at arbitrary positions in the prompt, not necessarily as a contiguous block. Our experimental results demonstrate that this procedure can obtain strong certified safety guarantees on harmful prompts while maintaining good empirical performance on safe prompts. Additionally, we propose three efficient empirical defenses: i) RandEC, a randomized subsampling version of erase-and-check; ii) GreedyEC, which greedily erases tokens that maximize the softmax score of the harmful class; and iii) GradEC, which uses gradient information to optimize tokens to erase. We demonstrate their effectiveness against adversarial prompts generated by the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack algorithm. The code for our experiments is available at this https URL.

Reward modeling (a.k.a., preference modeling) is instrumental for aligning large language models with human preferences, particularly within the context of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While conventional reward models (RMs) have exhibited remarkable scalability, they oft struggle with fundamental functionality such as arithmetic computation, code execution, and factual lookup. In this paper, we propose a tool-augmented preference modeling approach, named Themis, to address these limitations by empowering RMs with access to external environments, including calculators and search engines. This approach not only fosters synergy between tool utilization and reward grading but also enhances interpretive capacity and scoring reliability. Our study delves into the integration of external tools into RMs, enabling them to interact with diverse external sources and construct task-specific tool engagement and reasoning traces in an autoregressive manner. We validate our approach across a wide range of domains, incorporating seven distinct external tools. Our experimental results demonstrate a noteworthy overall improvement of 17.7% across eight tasks in preference ranking. Furthermore, our approach outperforms Gopher 280B by 7.3% on TruthfulQA task in zero-shot evaluation. In human evaluations, RLHF trained with Themis attains an average win rate of 32% when compared to baselines across four distinct tasks. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive collection of tool-related RM datasets, incorporating data from seven distinct tool APIs, totaling 15,000 instances. We have made the code, data, and model checkpoints publicly available to facilitate and inspire further research advancements\footnote{\url{this https URL}}.

The Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) task aims to answer natural language questions based on a given knowledge base. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in language understanding and can be used to solve this task. In doing so, a major challenge for LLMs is to overcome the immensity and heterogeneity of knowledge base schemas.Existing methods bypass this challenge by initially employing LLMs to generate drafts of logic forms without schema-specific details.Then, an extra module is used to inject schema information to these this http URL contrast, in this paper, we propose a simple In-Context Schema Understanding (ICSU) method that enables LLMs to directly understand schemas by leveraging in-context learning. Specifically, ICSU provides schema information to LLMs using schema-related annotated examples. We investigate three example retrieval strategies based on raw questions, anonymized questions, and generated SPARQL queries. Experimental results show that ICSU demonstrates competitive performance compared to baseline methods on both the KQA Pro and WebQSP datasets.

With the rise of social media, users are exposed to many misleading claims. However, the pervasive noise inherent in these posts presents a challenge in identifying precise and prominent claims that require verification. Extracting the important claims from such posts is arduous and time-consuming, yet it is an underexplored problem. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. We introduce a novel task, Claim Normalization (aka ClaimNorm), which aims to decompose complex and noisy social media posts into more straightforward and understandable forms, termed normalized claims. We propose CACN, a pioneering approach that leverages chain-of-thought and claim check-worthiness estimation, mimicking human reasoning processes, to comprehend intricate claims. Moreover, we capitalize on the in-context learning capabilities of large language models to provide guidance and to improve claim normalization. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we meticulously compile a comprehensive real-world dataset, CLAN, comprising more than 6k instances of social media posts alongside their respective normalized claims. Our experiments demonstrate that CACN outperforms several baselines across various evaluation measures. Finally, our rigorous error analysis validates CACN's capabilities and pitfalls.

Biomedical triple extraction systems aim to automatically extract biomedical entities and relations between entities. While current unified information extraction models showcase state-of-the-art performance, they face challenges in understanding relationships between entities within intricate biomedical sentences. Furthermore, the absence of a high-quality biomedical triple extraction dataset impedes the progress in developing robust triple extraction systems. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel retrieval-based framework for biomedical triple extraction, namely PeTailor, which explicitly retrieves the relevant document from our pre-built diverse chunk database using a novel tailored chunk scorer and integrates the retrieved information into the input of a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate the corresponding triple (head entity, relation, tail entity) for the input sentence. Additionally, we present GM-CIHT, an expert-annotated biomedical triple extraction dataset that covers a wider range of relation types. Experimental results show that our proposed PeTailor method achieves state-of-the-art performance on GM-CIHT and two standard biomedical triple extraction datasets

We propose the Data Contamination Quiz (DCQ), a simple and effective approach to detect data contamination in large language models (LLMs) and estimate the amount of it. Specifically, we frame data contamination detection as a series of multiple-choice questions and devise a quiz format wherein three perturbed versions of each dataset instance are created. These changes only include word-level perturbations. The generated perturbed versions, along with the original instance, form the options in the DCQ, with an extra option accommodating the possibility that none of the provided choices is correct. Given that the only distinguishing signal among the choices is the exact wording relative to the original instance, an LLM, when tasked with identifying the original instance from the choices, gravitates towards the original one if it has been exposed to it in its pre-training phase--a trait intrinsic to LLMs. Tested over several datasets with GPT-4/3.5, our findings--while fully lacking access to LLMs' pre-training data and internal parameters--suggest that DCQ uncovers greater contamination levels compared to existing detection methods and proficiently bypasses more safety filters, especially those set to avoid generating copyrighted contents.

Large language models (LLMs) can explain their predictions through post-hoc or Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations. But an LLM could make up reasonably sounding explanations that are unfaithful to its underlying reasoning. Recent work has designed tests that aim to judge the faithfulness of post-hoc or CoT explanations. In this work we argue that these faithfulness tests do not measure faithfulness to the models' inner workings -- but rather their self-consistency at output level. Our contributions are three-fold: i) We clarify the status of faithfulness tests in view of model explainability, characterising them as self-consistency tests instead. This assessment we underline by ii) constructing a Comparative Consistency Bank for self-consistency tests that for the first time compares existing tests on a common suite of 11 open LLMs and 5 tasks -- including iii) our new self-consistency measure CC-SHAP. CC-SHAP is a fine-grained measure (not a test) of LLM self-consistency. It compares how a model's input contributes to the predicted answer and to generating the explanation. Our fine-grained CC-SHAP metric allows us iii) to compare LLM behaviour when making predictions and to analyse the effect of other consistency tests at a deeper level, which takes us one step further towards measuring faithfulness by bringing us closer to the internals of the model than strictly surface output-oriented tests.

Instruction tuning has remarkably advanced large language models (LLMs) in understanding and responding to diverse human instructions. Despite the success in high-resource languages, its application in lower-resource ones faces challenges due to the imbalanced foundational abilities of LLMs across different languages, stemming from the uneven language distribution in their pre-training data. To tackle this issue, we propose pivot language guided generation (PLUG), an approach that utilizes a high-resource language, primarily English, as the pivot to enhance instruction tuning in lower-resource languages. It trains the model to first process instructions in the pivot language, and then produce responses in the target language. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a benchmark, X-AlpacaEval, of instructions in 4 languages (Chinese, Korean, Italian, and Spanish), each annotated by professional translators. Our approach demonstrates a significant improvement in the instruction-following abilities of LLMs by 29% on average, compared to directly responding in the target language alone. Further experiments validate the versatility of our approach by employing alternative pivot languages beyond English to assist languages where LLMs exhibit lower proficiency. Our code and data are available at this https URL.

In this paper, we demonstrate that an inherent waveform pattern in the attention allocation of large language models (LLMs) significantly affects their performance in tasks demanding a high degree of context awareness, such as utilizing LLMs for tool-use. Specifically, the crucial information in the context will be potentially overlooked by model when it is positioned in the trough zone of the attention waveform, leading to decreased performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel inference method named Attention Buckets. It allows LLMs to process their input through multiple parallel processes. Each process utilizes a distinct base angle for the rotary position embedding, thereby creating a unique attention waveform. By compensating an attention trough of a particular process with an attention peak of another process, our approach enhances LLM's awareness to various contextual positions, thus mitigating the risk of overlooking crucial information. In the largest tool-use benchmark, our method elevates a 7B model to achieve state-of-the-art performance, comparable to that of GPT-4. On other benchmarks and some RAG tasks, which also demand a thorough understanding of contextual content, Attention Buckets also exhibited notable enhancements in performance.

In this paper, we introduce InfiAgent-DABench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM-based agents on data analysis tasks. These tasks require agents to end-to-end solving complex tasks by interacting with an execution environment. This benchmark contains DAEval, a dataset consisting of 257 data analysis questions derived from 52 CSV files, and an agent framework which incorporates LLMs to serve as data analysis agents for both serving and evaluation. Since data analysis questions are often open-ended and hard to evaluate without human supervision, we adopt a format-prompting technique to convert each question into a closed-form format so that they can be automatically evaluated. Our extensive benchmarking of 34 LLMs uncovers the current challenges encountered in data analysis tasks. In addition, building on top of our agent framework, we develop a specialized agent, DAAgent, which surpasses GPT-3.5 by 3.9% on DABench.

We apply topic modeling and keyword extraction techniques to create initial topic taxonomies and LLMs to post-process the resulting terms and create a hierarchy. To expand an existing taxonomy with new terms, we use zero-shot prompting to find out where to add new nodes, which, to our knowledge, is the first work to present such an approach to taxonomy tasks. We use the resulting taxonomies to assign tags that characterize merchants from a retail bank dataset. To evaluate our work, we asked 12 volunteers to answer a two-part form in which we first assessed the quality of the taxonomies created and then the tags assigned to merchants based on that taxonomy. The evaluation revealed a coherence rate exceeding 90% for the chosen taxonomies. The taxonomies' expansion with LLMs also showed exciting results for parent node prediction, with an f1-score above 70% in our taxonomies.

Despite the advancements in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning, solving competition-level math problems remains a significant challenge, especially for open-source LLMs without external tools. We introduce the MMIQC dataset, comprising a mixture of processed web data and synthetic question-response pairs, aimed at enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of base language models. Models fine-tuned on MMIQC consistently surpass their counterparts in performance on the MATH benchmark across various model sizes. Notably, Qwen-72B-MMIQC achieves a 45.0% accuracy, exceeding the previous open-source state-of-the-art by 8.2% and outperforming the initial version GPT-4 released in 2023. Extensive evaluation results on Hungarian high school finals suggest that such improvement can generalize to unseen data. Our ablation study on MMIQC reveals that a large part of the improvement can be attributed to our novel augmentation method, Iterative Question Composing (IQC), which involves iteratively composing new questions from seed problems using an LLM and applying rejection sampling through another LLM. The MMIQC dataset is available on the HuggingFace hub at this https URL. Our code is available at this https URL.

The advent of large language models (LLMs) has enabled significant performance gains in the field of natural language processing. However, recent studies have found that LLMs often resort to shortcuts when performing tasks, creating an illusion of enhanced performance while lacking generalizability in their decision rules. This phenomenon introduces challenges in accurately assessing natural language understanding in LLMs. Our paper provides a concise survey of relevant research in this area and puts forth a perspective on the implications of shortcut learning in the evaluation of language models, specifically for NLU tasks. This paper urges more research efforts to be put towards deepening our comprehension of shortcut learning, contributing to the development of more robust language models, and raising the standards of NLU evaluation in real-world scenarios.

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, encounter `jailbreak' challenges, wherein safeguards are circumvented to generate ethically harmful prompts. This study introduces a straightforward black-box method for efficiently crafting jailbreak prompts, addressing the significant complexity and computational costs associated with conventional methods. Our technique iteratively transforms harmful prompts into benign expressions directly utilizing the target LLM, predicated on the hypothesis that LLMs can autonomously generate expressions that evade safeguards. Through experiments conducted with ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) and Gemini-Pro, our method consistently achieved an attack success rate exceeding 80% within an average of five iterations for forbidden questions and proved robust against model updates. The jailbreak prompts generated were not only naturally-worded and succinct but also challenging to defend against. These findings suggest that the creation of effective jailbreak prompts is less complex than previously believed, underscoring the heightened risk posed by black-box jailbreak attacks.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable success in long-form context comprehension tasks. However, their capacity to generate long contents, such as reports and articles, remains insufficiently explored. Current benchmarks do not adequately assess LLMs' ability to produce informative and comprehensive content, necessitating a more rigorous evaluation approach. In this study, we introduce \textsc{ProxyQA}, a framework for evaluating long-form text generation, comprising in-depth human-curated \textit{meta-questions} spanning various domains. Each meta-question contains corresponding \textit{proxy-questions} with annotated answers. LLMs are prompted to generate extensive content in response to these meta-questions. Utilizing an evaluator and incorporating generated content as background context, \textsc{ProxyQA} evaluates the quality of generated content based on the evaluator's performance in answering the \textit{proxy-questions}. We examine multiple LLMs, emphasizing \textsc{ProxyQA}'s demanding nature as a high-quality assessment tool. Human evaluation demonstrates that evaluating through \textit{proxy-questions} is a highly self-consistent and human-criteria-correlated validation method. The dataset and leaderboard will be available at \url{this https URL}.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), have significantly advanced healthcare applications and demonstrated potentials in intelligent medical treatment. However, there are conspicuous challenges such as vast data volumes and inconsistent symptom characterization standards, preventing full integration of healthcare AI systems with individual patients' needs. To promote professional and personalized healthcare, we propose an innovative framework, Heath-LLM, which combines large-scale feature extraction and medical knowledge trade-off scoring. Compared to traditional health management applications, our system has three main advantages: (1) It integrates health reports and medical knowledge into a large model to ask relevant questions to large language model for disease prediction; (2) It leverages a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) mechanism to enhance feature extraction; (3) It incorporates a semi-automated feature updating framework that can merge and delete features to improve accuracy of disease prediction. We experiment on a large number of health reports to assess the effectiveness of Health-LLM system. The results indicate that the proposed system surpasses the existing ones and has the potential to significantly advance disease prediction and personalized health management.

The inherent complexity of structured longitudinal Electronic Health Records (EHR) data poses a significant challenge when integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs), which are traditionally tailored for natural language processing. Motivated by the urgent need for swift decision-making during new disease outbreaks, where traditional predictive models often fail due to a lack of historical data, this research investigates the adaptability of LLMs, like GPT-4, to EHR data. We particularly focus on their zero-shot capabilities, which enable them to make predictions in scenarios in which they haven't been explicitly trained. In response to the longitudinal, sparse, and knowledge-infused nature of EHR data, our prompting approach involves taking into account specific EHR characteristics such as units and reference ranges, and employing an in-context learning strategy that aligns with clinical contexts. Our comprehensive experiments on the MIMIC-IV and TJH datasets demonstrate that with our elaborately designed prompting framework, LLMs can improve prediction performance in key tasks such as mortality, length-of-stay, and 30-day readmission by about 35\%, surpassing ML models in few-shot settings. Our research underscores the potential of LLMs in enhancing clinical decision-making, especially in urgent healthcare situations like the outbreak of emerging diseases with no labeled data.

Massive open online courses (MOOCs) unlock the doors to free education for anyone around the globe with access to a computer and the internet. Despite this democratization of learning, the massive enrollment in these courses means it is almost impossible for one instructor to assess every student's writing assignment. As a result, peer grading, often guided by a straightforward rubric, is the method of choice. While convenient, peer grading often falls short in terms of reliability and validity. In this study, using 18 distinct settings, we explore the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to replace peer grading in MOOCs. Specifically, we focus on two state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, across three distinct courses: Introductory Astronomy, Astrobiology, and the History and Philosophy of Astronomy. To instruct LLMs, we use three different prompts based on a variant of the zero-shot chain-of-thought (Zero-shot-CoT) prompting technique: Zero-shot-CoT combined with instructor-provided correct answers; Zero-shot-CoT in conjunction with both instructor-formulated answers and rubrics; and Zero-shot-CoT with instructor-offered correct answers and LLM-generated rubrics. Our results show that Zero-shot-CoT, when integrated with instructor-provided answers and rubrics, produces grades that are more aligned with those assigned by instructors compared to peer grading. However, the History and Philosophy of Astronomy course proves to be more challenging in terms of grading as opposed to other courses. Finally, our study reveals a promising direction for automating grading systems for MOOCs, especially in subjects with well-defined rubrics.

Background: The emergence of generative AI tools, empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs), has shown powerful capabilities in generating content. To date, the assessment of the usefulness of such content, generated by what is known as prompt engineering, has become an interesting research question. Objectives Using the mean of prompt engineering, we assess the similarity and closeness of such contents to real literature produced by scientists. Methods In this exploratory analysis, (1) we prompt-engineer ChatGPT and Google Bard to generate clinical content to be compared with literature counterparts, (2) we assess the similarities of the contents generated by comparing them with counterparts from biomedical literature. Our approach is to use text-mining approaches to compare documents and associated bigrams and to use network analysis to assess the terms' centrality. Results The experiments demonstrated that ChatGPT outperformed Google Bard in cosine document similarity (38% to 34%), Jaccard document similarity (23% to 19%), TF-IDF bigram similarity (47% to 41%), and term network centrality (degree and closeness). We also found new links that emerged in ChatGPT bigram networks that did not exist in literature bigram networks. Conclusions: The obtained similarity results show that ChatGPT outperformed Google Bard in document similarity, bigrams, and degree and closeness centrality. We also observed that ChatGPT offers linkage to terms that are connected in the literature. Such connections could inspire asking interesting questions and generate new hypotheses.

In-context learning (ICL, also known as few-shot prompting) has been the standard method of adapting LLMs to downstream tasks, by learning from a few input-output examples. Nonetheless, all ICL-based approaches only learn from correct input-output pairs. In this paper, we revisit this paradigm, by learning more from the few given input-output examples. We introduce Learning Principles (LEAP): First, we intentionally induce the model to make mistakes on these few examples; then we reflect on these mistakes, and learn explicit task-specific "principles" from them, which help solve similar problems and avoid common mistakes; finally, we prompt the model to answer unseen test questions using the original few-shot examples and these learned general principles. We evaluate LEAP on a wide range of benchmarks, including multi-hop question answering (Hotpot QA), textual QA (DROP), Big-Bench Hard reasoning, and math problems (GSM8K and MATH); in all these benchmarks, LEAP improves the strongest available LLMs such as GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4 turbo and Claude-2.1. For example, LEAP improves over the standard few-shot prompting using GPT-4 by 7.5% in DROP, and by 3.3% in HotpotQA. Importantly, LEAP does not require any more input or examples than the standard few-shot prompting settings.

Cloud-based large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have increasingly become integral to daily operations, serving as vital tools across various applications. While these models offer substantial benefits in terms of accessibility and functionality, they also introduce significant privacy concerns: the transmission and storage of user data in cloud infrastructures pose substantial risks of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information; even if the transmission and storage of data is encrypted, the LLM service provider itself still knows the real contents of the data, preventing individuals or entities from confidently using such LLM services. To address these concerns, this paper proposes a simple yet effective mechanism EmojiCrypt to protect user privacy. It uses Emoji to encrypt the user inputs before sending them to LLM, effectively rendering them indecipherable to human or LLM's examination while retaining the original intent of the prompt, thus ensuring the model's performance remains unaffected. We conduct experiments on three tasks, personalized recommendation, sentiment analysis, and tabular data analysis. Experiment results reveal that EmojiCrypt can encrypt personal information within prompts in such a manner that not only prevents the discernment of sensitive data by humans or LLM itself, but also maintains or even improves the precision without further tuning, achieving comparable or even better task accuracy than directly prompting the LLM without prompt encryption. These results highlight the practicality of adopting encryption measures that safeguard user privacy without compromising the functional integrity and performance of LLMs. Code and dataset are available at this https URL.

Large language models (LLMs) powered conversational search systems have already been used by hundreds of millions of people, and are believed to bring many benefits over conventional search. However, while decades of research and public discourse interrogated the risk of search systems in increasing selective exposure and creating echo chambers -- limiting exposure to diverse opinions and leading to opinion polarization, little is known about such a risk of LLM-powered conversational search. We conduct two experiments to investigate: 1) whether and how LLM-powered conversational search increases selective exposure compared to conventional search; 2) whether and how LLMs with opinion biases that either reinforce or challenge the user's view change the effect. Overall, we found that participants engaged in more biased information querying with LLM-powered conversational search, and an opinionated LLM reinforcing their views exacerbated this bias. These results present critical implications for the development of LLMs and conversational search systems, and the policy governing these technologies.

Federated learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning paradigm in which a central server coordinates multiple participants (clients) collaboratively to train on decentralized data. In practice, FL often faces statistical, system, and model heterogeneities, which inspires the field of Model-Heterogeneous Personalized Federated Learning (MHPFL). With the increased interest in adopting large language models (LLMs) in FL, the existing MHPFL methods cannot achieve acceptable computational and communication costs, while maintaining satisfactory model performance. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel and efficient model-heterogeneous personalized Federated learning framework based on LoRA tuning (pFedLoRA). Inspired by the popular LoRA method for fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs with a low-rank model (a.k.a., an adapter), we design a homogeneous small adapter to facilitate federated client's heterogeneous local model training with our proposed iterative training for global-local knowledge exchange. The homogeneous small local adapters are aggregated on the FL server to generate a global adapter. We theoretically prove the convergence of pFedLoRA. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that pFedLoRA outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines, beating the best method by 1.35% in test accuracy, 11.81 times computation overhead reduction and 7.41 times communication cost saving.

Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm to enable collaborative model training with decentralized data. However, the training process of Large Language Models (LLMs) generally incurs the update of significant parameters, which limits the applicability of FL techniques to tackle the LLMs in real scenarios. Prompt tuning can significantly reduce the number of parameters to update, but it either incurs performance degradation or low training efficiency. The straightforward utilization of prompt tuning in the FL often raises non-trivial communication costs and dramatically degrades performance. In addition, the decentralized data is generally non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID), which brings client drift problems and thus poor performance. This paper proposes a Parameter-efficient prompt Tuning approach with Adaptive Optimization, i.e., FedPepTAO, to enable efficient and effective FL of LLMs. First, an efficient partial prompt tuning approach is proposed to improve performance and efficiency simultaneously. Second, a novel adaptive optimization method is developed to address the client drift problems on both the device and server sides to enhance performance further. Extensive experiments based on 10 datasets demonstrate the superb performance (up to 60.8\% in terms of accuracy) and efficiency (up to 97.59\% in terms of training time) of FedPepTAO compared with 9 baseline approaches.

Approximate value iteration (AVI) is a family of algorithms for reinforcement learning (RL) that aims to obtain an approximation of the optimal value function. Generally, AVI algorithms implement an iterated procedure where each step consists of (i) an application of the Bellman operator and (ii) a projection step into a considered function space. Notoriously, the Bellman operator leverages transition samples, which strongly determine its behavior, as uninformative samples can result in negligible updates or long detours, whose detrimental effects are further exacerbated by the computationally intensive projection step. To address these issues, we propose a novel alternative approach based on learning an approximate version of the Bellman operator rather than estimating it through samples as in AVI approaches. This way, we are able to (i) generalize across transition samples and (ii) avoid the computationally intensive projection step. For this reason, we call our novel operator projected Bellman operator (PBO). We formulate an optimization problem to learn PBO for generic sequential decision-making problems, and we theoretically analyze its properties in two representative classes of RL problems. Furthermore, we theoretically study our approach under the lens of AVI and devise algorithmic implementations to learn PBO in offline and online settings by leveraging neural network parameterizations. Finally, we empirically showcase the benefits of PBO w.r.t. the regular Bellman operator on several RL problems.

Large language models are widespread, with their performance on benchmarks frequently guiding user preferences for one model over another. However, the vast amount of data these models are trained on can inadvertently lead to contamination with public benchmarks, thus compromising performance measurements. While recently developed contamination detection methods try to address this issue, they overlook the possibility of deliberate contamination by malicious model providers aiming to evade detection. We argue that this setting is of crucial importance as it casts doubt on the reliability of public benchmarks. To more rigorously study this issue, we propose a categorization of both model providers and contamination detection methods. This reveals vulnerabilities in existing methods that we exploit with EAL, a simple yet effective contamination technique that significantly inflates benchmark performance while completely evading current detection methods.

Memory-efficient finetuning of large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted huge attention with the increasing size of LLMs, primarily due to the constraints posed by GPU memory limitations and the comparable results of these methods with full finetuning. Despite the advancements, current strategies for memory-efficient finetuning, such as QLoRA, exhibit inconsistent performance across diverse bit-width quantizations and multifaceted tasks. This inconsistency largely stems from the detrimental impact of the quantization process on preserved knowledge, leading to catastrophic forgetting and undermining the utilization of pretrained models for finetuning purposes. In this work, we introduce a novel quantization framework named ApiQ, designed to restore the lost information from quantization by concurrently initializing LoRA components and quantizing the weights of LLMs. This approach ensures the maintenance of the original LLM's activation precision while mitigating the error propagation from shallower into deeper layers. Through comprehensive evaluations conducted on a spectrum of language tasks with various models, ApiQ demonstrably minimizes activation error during quantization. Consequently, it consistently achieves superior finetuning outcomes across various bit-widths of quantization.

Given the generational gap in available hardware between lay practitioners and the most endowed institutions, LLMs are becoming increasingly inaccessible as they grow in size. Whilst many approaches have been proposed to compress LLMs to make their resource consumption manageable, these methods themselves tend to be resource intensive, putting them out of the reach of the very user groups they target. In this work, we explore the problem of structured pruning of LLMs using only forward passes. We seek to empower practitioners to prune models so large that their available hardware has just enough memory to run inference. We develop Bonsai, a gradient-free, perturbative pruning method capable of delivering small, fast, and accurate pruned models.
We observe that Bonsai outputs pruned models that (i) outperform those generated by more expensive gradient-based structured pruning methods, and (ii) are twice as fast (with comparable accuracy) as those generated by semi-structured pruning methods requiring comparable resources as Bonsai. We also leverage Bonsai to produce a new sub-2B model using a single A6000 that yields state-of-the-art performance on 4/6 tasks on the Huggingface Open LLM leaderboard.

This paper introduces FedSecurity, an end-to-end benchmark designed to simulate adversarial attacks and corresponding defense mechanisms in Federated Learning (FL). FedSecurity comprises two pivotal components: FedAttacker, which facilitates the simulation of a variety of attacks during FL training, and FedDefender, which implements defensive mechanisms to counteract these attacks. As an open-source library, FedSecurity enhances its usability compared to from-scratch implementations that focus on specific attack/defense scenarios based on the following features: i) It offers extensive customization options to accommodate a broad range of machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, ResNet, and GAN) and FL optimizers (e.g., FedAVG, FedOPT, and FedNOVA); ii) it enables exploring the variability in the effectiveness of attacks and defenses across different datasets and models; and iii) it supports flexible configuration and customization through a configuration file and some provided APIs. We further demonstrate FedSecurity's utility and adaptability through federated training of Large Language Models (LLMs), showcasing its potential to impact a wide range of complex applications.

Dense retrieval (DR) converts queries and documents into dense embeddings and measures the similarity between queries and documents in vector space. One of the challenges in DR is the lack of domain-specific training data. While DR models can learn from large-scale public datasets like MS MARCO through transfer learning, evidence shows that not all DR models and domains can benefit from transfer learning equally. Recently, some researchers have resorted to large language models (LLMs) to improve the zero-shot and few-shot DR models. However, the hard prompts or human-written prompts utilized in these works cannot guarantee the good quality of generated weak queries. To tackle this, we propose soft prompt tuning for augmenting DR (SPTAR): For each task, we leverage soft prompt-tuning to optimize a task-specific soft prompt on limited ground truth data and then prompt the LLMs to tag unlabeled documents with weak queries, yielding enough weak document-query pairs to train task-specific dense retrievers. We design a filter to select high-quality example document-query pairs in the prompt to further improve the quality of weak tagged queries. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work utilizing soft prompt tuning to augment DR models. The experiments demonstrate that SPTAR outperforms the unsupervised baselines BM25 and the recently proposed LLMs-based augmentation method for DR.

Although large language models (LLMs) are reshaping various aspects of human life, our current understanding of their impacts remains somewhat constrained. Here we investigate the impact of LLMs on human communication, using data on consumer complaints in the financial industry. By employing an AI detection tool on more than 820K complaints gathered by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), we find a sharp increase in the likely use of LLMs shortly after the release of ChatGPT. Moreover, the likely LLM usage was positively correlated with message persuasiveness (i.e., increased likelihood of obtaining relief from financial firms). Computational linguistic analyses suggest that the positive correlation may be explained by LLMs' enhancement of various linguistic features. Based on the results of these observational studies, we hypothesize that LLM usage may enhance a comprehensive set of linguistic features, increasing message persuasiveness to receivers with heterogeneous linguistic preferences (i.e., linguistic feature alignment). We test this hypothesis in preregistered experiments and find support for it. As an instance of early empirical demonstrations of LLM usage for enhancing persuasion, our research highlights the transformative potential of LLMs in human communication.

Generative artificial intelligence tools like large language models are rapidly transforming academic research and real world applications. However, discussions on ethical guidelines for generative AI in science remain fragmented, underscoring the urgent need for consensus based standards. This paper offers an initial framework by developing analyses and mitigation strategies across five key themes: understanding model limitations regarding truthfulness and bias; respecting privacy, confidentiality, and copyright; avoiding plagiarism and policy violations when incorporating model output; ensuring applications provide overall benefit; and using AI transparently and reproducibly. Common scenarios are outlined to demonstrate potential ethical violations. We argue that global consensus coupled with professional training and reasonable enforcement are critical to promoting the benefits of AI while safeguarding research integrity.

With the increasing need for inclusive and user-friendly technology, web accessibility is crucial to ensuring equal access to online content for individuals with disabilities, including visual, auditory, cognitive, or motor impairments. Despite the existence of accessibility guidelines and standards such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and the Web Accessibility Initiative (W3C), over 90% of websites still fail to meet the necessary accessibility requirements. For web users with disabilities, there exists a need for a tool to automatically fix web page accessibility errors. While research has demonstrated methods to find and target accessibility errors, no research has focused on effectively correcting such violations. This paper presents a novel approach to correcting accessibility violations on the web by modifying the document object model (DOM) in real time with foundation models. Leveraging accessibility error information, large language models (LLMs), and prompt engineering techniques, we achieved greater than a 51% reduction in accessibility violation errors after corrections on our novel benchmark: ACCESS. Our work demonstrates a valuable approach toward the direction of inclusive web content, and provides directions for future research to explore advanced methods to automate web accessibility.

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved promising zero-shot accuracy on visual question answering (VQA) -- a fundamental task affecting various downstream applications and domains. Given the great potential for the broad use of these models, it is important to investigate their limitations in dealing with different image and question properties. In this work, we investigate whether MLLMs can perceive small details as well as large details in images. In particular, we show that their zero-shot accuracy in answering visual questions is very sensitive to the size of the visual subject of the question, declining up to 46% with size. Furthermore, we show that this effect is causal by observing that human visual cropping can significantly mitigate their sensitivity to size. Inspired by the usefulness of human cropping, we then propose five automatic visual cropping methods -- leveraging either external localization models or the decision process of the given MLLM itself -- as inference time mechanisms to improve the zero-shot performance of MLLMs. We study their effectiveness on four popular VQA datasets, and a subset of the VQAv2 dataset tailored towards fine visual details. Our findings suggest that MLLMs should be used with caution in detail-sensitive VQA applications, and that visual cropping is a promising direction to improve their zero-shot performance. To facilitate further investigation of MLLMs' behaviors, our code and data are publicly released.

Over the past few years, Large Language Models of Code (Code LLMs) have started to have a significant impact on programming practice. Code LLMs are also emerging as building blocks for research in programming languages and software engineering. However, Code LLMs produce impressive results on programming languages that are well represented in their training data (e.g., Java, Python, or JavaScript), but struggle with low-resource languages that have limited training data available. Low resource languages include OCaml, Racket, and several others.
This paper presents an effective approach for boosting the performance of Code LLMs on low-resource languages using semi-synthetic data. Our approach, MultiPL-T, translates training data from high-resource languages into training data for low-resource languages in the following way. 1) We use a Code LLM to synthesize tests for commented code from a high-resource language, filtering out faulty tests and code with low test coverage. 2) We use a Code LLM to translate Python code to a target low-resource language, and use tests to validate the translation. We apply this approach to generate tens of thousands of validated training items for Julia, Lua, OCaml, R, and Racket. Furthermore, we use an open model (StarCoderBase) with open training data (The Stack), which allows us to decontaminate benchmarks, train models without violating licenses, and run experiments that could not otherwise be done.
With MultiPL-T generated data, we present fine-tuned versions of StarCoderBase and Code Llama for Julia, Lua, OCaml, R, and Racket. On established benchmarks (MultiPL-E), these models outperform other open Code LLMs. The MultiPL-T approach is easy to apply to new languages, and is significantly more efficient and effective than alternatives such as training longer.

Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) have become ubiquitous in machine learning technologies because they are interesting for numerous methods. The field of machine learning holds the potential for substantial advancements across various domains, as exemplified by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, despite the growing interest, persistent concerns include issues related to reproducibility and energy consumption. Reproducibility is crucial for robust scientific inquiry and explainability, while energy efficiency underscores the imperative to conserve finite global resources. This study delves into the investigation of whether the leading Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) employed in machine learning languages, libraries, and frameworks uphold statistical quality and numerical reproducibility when compared to the original C implementation of the respective PRNG algorithms. Additionally, we aim to evaluate the time efficiency and energy consumption of various implementations. Our experiments encompass Python, NumPy, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, utilizing the Mersenne Twister, PCG, and Philox algorithms. Remarkably, we verified that the temporal performance of machine learning technologies closely aligns with that of C-based implementations, with instances of achieving even superior performances. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that ML technologies consumed only 10% more energy than their C-implementation counterparts. However, while statistical quality was found to be comparable, achieving numerical reproducibility across different platforms for identical seeds and algorithms was not achieved.

Machine learning models are widely used but can also often be wrong. Users would benefit from a reliable indication of whether a given output from a given model should be trusted, so a rational decision can be made whether to use the output or not. For example, outputs can be associated with a confidence measure; if this confidence measure is strongly associated with likelihood of correctness, then the model is said to be well-calibrated. In this case, for example, high-confidence outputs could be safely accepted, and low-confidence outputs rejected.
Calibration has so far been studied in mostly non-generative (e.g., classification) settings, especially in Software Engineering. However, generated code can quite often be wrong: Developers need to know when they should e.g., directly use, use after careful review, or discard model-generated code; thus Calibration is vital in generative settings. However, the notion of correctness of generated code is non-trivial, and thus so is Calibration. In this paper we make several contributions. We develop a framework for evaluating the Calibration of code-generating models. We consider several tasks, correctness criteria, datasets, and approaches, and find that by and large generative code models are not well-calibrated out of the box. We then show how Calibration can be improved, using standard methods such as Platt scaling. Our contributions will lead to better-calibrated decision-making in the current use of code generated by language models, and offers a framework for future research to further improve calibration methods for generative models in Software Engineering.

A recent theory shows that a multi-player decentralized partially observable Markov decision process can be transformed into an equivalent single-player game, enabling the application of \citeauthor{bellman}'s principle of optimality to solve the single-player game by breaking it down into single-stage subgames. However, this approach entangles the decision variables of all players at each single-stage subgame, resulting in backups with a double-exponential complexity. This paper demonstrates how to disentangle these decision variables while maintaining optimality under hierarchical information sharing, a prominent management style in our society. To achieve this, we apply the principle of optimality to solve any single-stage subgame by breaking it down further into smaller subgames, enabling us to make single-player decisions at a time. Our approach reveals that extensive-form games always exist with solutions to a single-stage subgame, significantly reducing time complexity. Our experimental results show that the algorithms leveraging these findings can scale up to much larger multi-player games without compromising optimality.
