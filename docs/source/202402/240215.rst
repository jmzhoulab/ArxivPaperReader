Modeling subrational agents, such as humans or economic households, is inherently challenging due to the difficulty in calibrating reinforcement learning models or collecting data that involves human subjects. Existing work highlights the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address complex reasoning tasks and mimic human communication, while simulation using LLMs as agents shows emergent social behaviors, potentially improving our comprehension of human conduct. In this paper, we propose to investigate the use of LLMs to generate synthetic human demonstrations, which are then used to learn subrational agent policies though Imitation Learning. We make an assumption that LLMs can be used as implicit computational models of humans, and propose a framework to use synthetic demonstrations derived from LLMs to model subrational behaviors that are characteristic of humans (e.g., myopic behavior or preference for risk aversion). We experimentally evaluate the ability of our framework to model sub-rationality through four simple scenarios, including the well-researched ultimatum game and marshmallow experiment. To gain confidence in our framework, we are able to replicate well-established findings from prior human studies associated with the above scenarios. We conclude by discussing the potential benefits, challenges and limitations of our framework.

Background: Large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-4 or Google's PaLM 2 are proposed as viable diagnostic support tools or even spoken of as replacements for "curbside consults". However, even LLMs specifically trained on medical topics may lack sufficient diagnostic accuracy for real-life applications.
Methods: Using collective intelligence methods and a dataset of 200 clinical vignettes of real-life cases, we assessed and compared the accuracy of differential diagnoses obtained by asking individual commercial LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4, Google PaLM 2, Cohere Command, Meta Llama 2) against the accuracy of differential diagnoses synthesized by aggregating responses from combinations of the same LLMs.
Results: We find that aggregating responses from multiple, various LLMs leads to more accurate differential diagnoses (average accuracy for 3 LLMs: $75.3\%\pm 1.6pp$) compared to the differential diagnoses produced by single LLMs (average accuracy for single LLMs: $59.0\%\pm 6.1pp$).
Discussion: The use of collective intelligence methods to synthesize differential diagnoses combining the responses of different LLMs achieves two of the necessary steps towards advancing acceptance of LLMs as a diagnostic support tool: (1) demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy and (2) eliminate dependence on a single commercial vendor.

In recent years, efforts have been made to use text information for better user profiling and item characterization in recommendations. However, text information can sometimes be of low quality, hindering its effectiveness for real-world applications. With knowledge and reasoning capabilities capsuled in Large Language Models (LLMs), utilizing LLMs emerges as a promising way for description improvement. However, existing ways of prompting LLMs with raw texts ignore structured knowledge of user-item interactions, which may lead to hallucination problems like inconsistent description generation. To this end, we propose a Graph-aware Convolutional LLM method to elicit LLMs to capture high-order relations in the user-item graph. To adapt text-based LLMs with structured graphs, We use the LLM as an aggregator in graph processing, allowing it to understand graph-based information step by step. Specifically, the LLM is required for description enhancement by exploring multi-hop neighbors layer by layer, thereby propagating information progressively in the graph. To enable LLMs to capture large-scale graph information, we break down the description task into smaller parts, which drastically reduces the context length of the token input with each step. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Large language models (LLMs) have accomplished remarkable reasoning performance in various domains. However, in the domain of reasoning tasks, we discover a frailty: LLMs are surprisingly brittle to the ordering of the premises, despite the fact that such ordering does not alter the underlying task. In particular, we observe that LLMs achieve the best performance when the premise order aligns with the context required in intermediate reasoning steps.
For example, in deductive reasoning tasks, presenting the premises in the same order as the ground truth proof in the prompt (as opposed to random ordering) drastically increases the model's accuracy. We first examine the effect of premise ordering on deductive reasoning on a variety of LLMs, and our evaluation shows that permuting the premise order can cause a performance drop of over 30%. In addition, we release the benchmark R-GSM, based on GSM8K, to examine the ordering effect for mathematical problem-solving, and we again observe a significant drop in accuracy, relative to the original GSM8K benchmark.

Large language models (LLMs) have performed well on several reasoning benchmarks, including ones that test analogical reasoning abilities. However, it has been debated whether they are actually performing humanlike abstract reasoning or instead employing less general processes that rely on similarity to what has been seen in their training data. Here we investigate the generality of analogy-making abilities previously claimed for LLMs (Webb, Holyoak, & Lu, 2023). We take one set of analogy problems used to evaluate LLMs and create a set of "counterfactual" variants-versions that test the same abstract reasoning abilities but that are likely dissimilar from any pre-training data. We test humans and three GPT models on both the original and counterfactual problems, and show that, while the performance of humans remains high for all the problems, the GPT models' performance declines sharply on the counterfactual set. This work provides evidence that, despite previously reported successes of LLMs on analogical reasoning, these models lack the robustness and generality of human analogy-making.

Recent large language models (LLMs) have witnessed significant advancement in various tasks, including mathematical reasoning and theorem proving. As these two tasks require strict and formal multi-step inference, they are appealing domains for exploring the reasoning ability of LLMs but still face important challenges. Previous studies such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have revealed the effectiveness of intermediate steps guidance. However, such step-wise annotation requires heavy labor, leading to insufficient training steps for current benchmarks. To fill this gap, this work introduces MUSTARD, a data generation framework that masters uniform synthesis of theorem and proof data of high quality and diversity. MUSTARD synthesizes data in three stages: (1) It samples a few mathematical concept seeds as the problem category. (2) Then, it prompts a generative language model with the sampled concepts to obtain both the problems and their step-wise formal solutions. (3) Lastly, the framework utilizes a proof assistant (e.g., Lean Prover) to filter the valid proofs. With the proposed MUSTARD, we present a theorem-and-proof benchmark MUSTARDSAUCE with 5,866 valid data points. Each data point contains an informal statement, an informal proof, and a translated formal proof that passes the prover validation. We perform extensive analysis and demonstrate that MUSTARD generates validated high-quality step-by-step data. We further apply the MUSTARDSAUCE for fine-tuning smaller language models. The fine-tuned Llama 2-7B achieves a 15.41% average relative performance gain in automated theorem proving, and 8.18% in math word problems.

Current conversational AI systems based on large language models (LLMs) are known to generate unsafe responses, agreeing to offensive user input or including toxic content. Previous research aimed to alleviate the toxicity, by fine-tuning LLM with manually annotated safe dialogue histories. However, the dependency on additional tuning requires substantial costs. To remove the dependency, we propose GrounDial, where response safety is achieved by grounding responses to commonsense social rules without requiring fine-tuning.
A hybrid approach of in-context learning and human-norm-guided decoding of GrounDial enables the response to be quantitatively and qualitatively safer even without additional data or tuning.

Diffusion-based image generation models such as DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion-XL demonstrate remarkable capabilities in generating images with realistic and unique compositions. Yet, these models are not robust in precisely reasoning about physical and spatial configurations of objects, especially when instructed with unconventional, thereby out-of-distribution descriptions, such as "a chair with five legs". In this paper, we propose a language agent with chain-of-3D-thoughts (L3GO), an inference-time approach that can reason about part-based 3D mesh generation of unconventional objects that current data-driven diffusion models struggle with. More concretely, we use large language models as agents to compose a desired object via trial-and-error within the 3D simulation environment. To facilitate our investigation, we develop a new benchmark, Unconventionally Feasible Objects (UFO), as well as SimpleBlenv, a wrapper environment built on top of Blender where language agents can build and compose atomic building blocks via API calls. Human and automatic GPT-4V evaluations show that our approach surpasses the standard GPT-4 and other language agents (e.g., ReAct and Reflexion) for 3D mesh generation on ShapeNet. Moreover, when tested on our UFO benchmark, our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art text-to-2D image and text-to-3D models based on human evaluation.

Prior studies on the emergence in large models have primarily focused on how the functional capabilities of large language models (LLMs) scale with model size. Our research, however, transcends this traditional paradigm, aiming to deepen our understanding of the emergence within LLMs by placing a special emphasis not just on the model size but more significantly on the complex behavior of neuron interactions during the training process. By introducing the concepts of "self-organization" and "multifractal analysis," we explore how neuron interactions dynamically evolve during training, leading to "emergence," mirroring the phenomenon in natural systems where simple micro-level interactions give rise to complex macro-level behaviors. To quantitatively analyze the continuously evolving interactions among neurons in large models during training, we propose the Neuron-based Multifractal Analysis (NeuroMFA).
Utilizing NeuroMFA, we conduct a comprehensive examination of the emergent behavior in LLMs through the lens of both model size and training process, paving new avenues for research into the emergence in large models.

The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has sparked widespread and general interest due to their strong language generation capabilities, offering great potential for both industry and research. While previous research delved into the security and privacy issues of LLMs, the extent to which these models can exhibit adversarial behavior remains largely unexplored. Addressing this gap, we investigate whether common publicly available LLMs have inherent capabilities to perturb text samples to fool safety measures, so-called adversarial examples resp.~attacks. More specifically, we investigate whether LLMs are inherently able to craft adversarial examples out of benign samples to fool existing safe rails. Our experiments, which focus on hate speech detection, reveal that LLMs succeed in finding adversarial perturbations, effectively undermining hate speech detection systems. Our findings carry significant implications for (semi-)autonomous systems relying on LLMs, highlighting potential challenges in their interaction with existing systems and safety measures.

We address the main problem of self-learning LLM: the question of what to learn. We propose a self-learning LLM framework that enables an LLM to independently learn previously unknown knowledge through self-assessment of their own hallucinations. Using the hallucination score, we introduce a new concept of Points in The Unknown (PiUs), along with one extrinsic and three intrinsic methods for automatic PiUs identification. It facilitates the creation of a self-learning loop that focuses exclusively on the knowledge gap in Points in The Unknown, resulting in a reduced hallucination score. We also developed evaluation metrics for gauging an LLM's self-learning capability. Our experiments revealed that 7B-Mistral models that have been finetuned or aligned are capable of self-learning considerably well. Our self-learning concept allows more efficient LLM updates and opens new perspectives for knowledge exchange. It may also increase public trust in AI.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, educational institutions have embarked on digital transformation projects. The success of these projects depends on integrating new technologies and understanding the needs of digitally literate students. The "learning by doing" approach suggests that real success in learning new skills is achieved when students can try out and practise these skills. In this article, we demonstrate how Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance the quality of teaching by using ChatGPT in a role-playing simulation game scenario to promote active learning. Moreover, we discuss how LLMs can boost students' interest in learning by allowing them to practice real-life scenarios using ChatGPT.

Projecting intermediate representations onto the vocabulary is an increasingly popular interpretation tool for transformer-based LLMs, also known as the logit lens. We propose a quantitative extension to this approach and define spectral filters on intermediate representations based on partitioning the singular vectors of the vocabulary embedding and unembedding matrices into bands. We find that the signals exchanged in the tail end of the spectrum are responsible for attention sinking (Xiao et al. 2023), of which we provide an explanation. We find that the loss of pretrained models can be kept low despite suppressing sizable parts of the embedding spectrum in a layer-dependent way, as long as attention sinking is preserved. Finally, we discover that the representation of tokens that draw attention from many tokens have large projections on the tail end of the spectrum.

As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain wider adoption in various contexts, it becomes crucial to ensure they are reasonably safe, consistent, and reliable for an application at hand. This may require probing or auditing them. Probing LLMs with varied iterations of a single question could reveal potential inconsistencies in their knowledge or functionality. However, a tool for performing such audits with simple workflow and low technical threshold is lacking. In this demo, we introduce "AuditLLM," a novel tool designed to evaluate the performance of various LLMs in a methodical way. AuditLLM's core functionality lies in its ability to test a given LLM by auditing it using multiple probes generated from a single question, thereby identifying any inconsistencies in the model's understanding or operation. A reasonably robust, reliable, and consistent LLM should output semantically similar responses for a question asked differently or by different people. Based on this assumption, AuditLLM produces easily interpretable results regarding the LLM's consistencies from a single question that the user enters. A certain level of inconsistency has been shown to be an indicator of potential bias, hallucinations, and other issues. One could then use the output of AuditLLM to further investigate issues with the aforementioned LLM. To facilitate demonstration and practical uses, AuditLLM offers two key modes: (1) Live mode which allows instant auditing of LLMs by analyzing responses to real-time queries; (2) Batch mode which facilitates comprehensive LLM auditing by processing multiple queries at once for in-depth analysis. This tool is beneficial for both researchers and general users, as it enhances our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in generating responses, using a standardized auditing platform.

As LLMs become more pervasive across various users and scenarios, identifying potential issues when using these models becomes essential. Examples include bias, inconsistencies, and hallucination. Although auditing the LLM for these problems is desirable, it is far from being easy or solved. An effective method is to probe the LLM using different versions of the same question. This could expose inconsistencies in its knowledge or operation, indicating potential for bias or hallucination. However, to operationalize this auditing method at scale, we need an approach to create those probes reliably and automatically.
In this paper we propose an automatic and scalable solution, where one uses a different LLM along with human-in-the-loop. This approach offers verifiability and transparency, while avoiding circular reliance on the same LLMs, and increasing scientific rigor and generalizability. Specifically, we present a novel methodology with two phases of verification using humans: standardized evaluation criteria to verify responses, and a structured prompt template to generate desired probes. Experiments on a set of questions from TruthfulQA dataset show that we can generate a reliable set of probes from one LLM that can be used to audit inconsistencies in a different LLM. The criteria for generating and applying auditing probes is generalizable to various LLMs regardless of the underlying structure or training mechanism.

With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in numerous applications, the challenge of factuality and the propensity for hallucinations raises significant concerns. To address this issue, particularly in retrieval-augmented in-context learning, we introduce the hierarchical graph of thoughts (HGOT), a structured, multi-layered graph approach designed to enhance the retrieval of pertinent passages during in-context learning. The framework utilizes the emergent planning capabilities of LLMs, employing the divide-and-conquer strategy to break down complex queries into manageable sub-queries. It refines self-consistency majority voting for answer selection, which incorporates the recently proposed citation recall and precision metrics to assess the quality of thoughts, linking an answer's credibility intrinsically to the thought's quality. This methodology introduces a weighted system in majority voting, prioritizing answers based on the citation quality of their thoughts. Additionally, we propose a scoring mechanism for evaluating retrieved passages, considering factors such as citation frequency and quality, self-consistency confidence, and the retrieval module's ranking. Experiments reveal that HGOT outperforms other retrieval-augmented in-context learning methods, including Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP), ReAct, Self-Ask, and Retrieve-then-Read on different datasets by as much as $7\%$, demonstrating its efficacy in enhancing the factuality of LLMs.

Chemistry plays a crucial role in many domains, such as drug discovery and material science. While large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 exhibit remarkable capabilities on natural language processing tasks, existing work shows their performance on chemistry tasks is discouragingly low. In this paper, however, we demonstrate that our developed LLMs can achieve very strong results on a comprehensive set of chemistry tasks, outperforming the most advanced GPT-4 across all the tasks by a substantial margin and approaching the SoTA task-specific models. The key to our success is a large-scale, comprehensive, high-quality dataset for instruction tuning named SMolInstruct.
It contains 14 meticulously selected chemistry tasks and over three million high-quality samples, laying a solid foundation for training and evaluating LLMs for chemistry. Based on SMolInstruct, we fine-tune a set of open-source LLMs, among which, we find that Mistral serves as the best base model for chemistry tasks. We further conduct analysis on the impact of trainable parameters, providing insights for future research.

Prompt optimization aims to find the best prompt to a large language model (LLM) for a given task. LLMs have been successfully used to help find and improve prompt candidates for single-step tasks. However, realistic tasks for agents are multi-step and introduce new challenges: (1) Prompt content is likely to be more extensive and complex, making it more difficult for LLMs to analyze errors, (2) the impact of an individual step is difficult to evaluate, and (3) different people may have varied preferences about task execution.
While humans struggle to optimize prompts, they are good at providing feedback about LLM outputs; we therefore introduce a new LLM-driven discrete prompt optimization framework that incorporates human-designed feedback rules about potential errors to automatically offer direct suggestions for improvement. Our framework is stylized as a genetic algorithm in which an LLM generates new candidate prompts from a parent prompt and its associated feedback; we use a learned heuristic function that predicts prompt performance to efficiently sample from these candidates. This approach significantly outperforms both human-engineered prompts and several other prompt optimization methods across eight representative multi-step tasks (an average 27.7% and 28.2% improvement to current best methods on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, respectively). We further show that the score function for tasks can be modified to better align with individual preferences. We believe our work can serve as a benchmark for automatic prompt optimization for LLM-driven multi-step tasks. Datasets and Codes are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/PROMST.

When LLMs perform zero-shot inference, they typically use a prompt with a task specification, and generate a completion. However, there is no work to explore the possibility of the reverse - going from completion to task specification. In this paper, we employ both directions to perform cycle-supervised learning entirely in-context. Our goal is to create a forward map f : X -> Y (e.g. image -> generated caption), coupled with a backward map g : Y -> X (e.g. caption -> generated image) to construct a cycle-consistency "loss" (formulated as an update to the prompt) to enforce g(f(X)) ~= X. The technique, called CyclePrompt, uses cycle-consistency as a free supervisory signal to iteratively craft the prompt. Importantly, CyclePrompt reinforces model performance without expensive fine-tuning, without training data, and without the complexity of external environments (e.g. compilers, APIs). We demonstrate CyclePrompt in two domains: code generation and image captioning.
Our results on the HumanEval coding benchmark put us in first place on the leaderboard among models that do not rely on extra training data or usage of external environments, and third overall. Compared to the GPT4 baseline, we improve accuracy from 80.5% to 87.2%. In the vision-language space, we generate detailed image captions which outperform baseline zero-shot GPT4V captions, when tested against natural (VQAv2) and diagrammatic (FigureQA) visual question-answering benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of self-supervised learning for prompting.

The permanence of online content combined with the enhanced authorship identification techniques calls for stronger computational methods to protect the identity and privacy of online authorship when needed, e.g., blind reviews for scientific papers, anonymous online reviews, or anonymous interactions in the mental health forums. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised inference-time approach to authorship obfuscation to address the unique challenges of authorship obfuscation: lack of supervision data for diverse authorship and domains, and the need for a sufficient level of revision beyond simple paraphrasing to obfuscate the authorship, all the while preserving the original content and fluency.
We introduce JAMDEC, a user-controlled, inference-time algorithm for authorship obfuscation that can be in principle applied to any text and authorship. Our approach builds on small language models such as GPT2-XL in order to help avoid disclosing the original content to proprietary LLM's APIs, while also reducing the performance gap between small and large language models via algorithmic enhancement. The key idea behind our approach is to boost the creative power of smaller language models through constrained decoding, while also allowing for user-specified controls and flexibility. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach based on GPT2-XL outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods based on comparably small models, while performing competitively against GPT3.5 175B, a propriety model that is two orders of magnitudes larger.

Do current large language models (LLMs) better solve graph reasoning and generation tasks with parameter updates? In this paper, we propose InstructGraph, a framework that empowers LLMs with the abilities of graph reasoning and generation by instruction tuning and preference alignment.
Specifically, we first propose a structured format verbalizer to unify all graph data into a universal code-like format, which can simply represent the graph without any external graph-specific encoders. Furthermore, a graph instruction tuning stage is introduced to guide LLMs in solving graph reasoning and generation tasks. Finally, we identify potential hallucination problems in graph tasks and sample negative instances for preference alignment, the target of which is to enhance the output's reliability of the model. Extensive experiments across multiple graph-centric tasks exhibit that InstructGraph can achieve the best performance and outperform GPT-4 and LLaMA2 by more than 13\% and 38\%, respectively.

With tremendous efforts on developing effective e-commerce models, conventional e-commerce models show limited success in generalist e-commerce modeling, and suffer from unsatisfactory performance on new users and new products - a typical out-of-domain generalization challenge. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate outstanding performance in generalist modeling and out-of-domain generalizability in many fields. Toward fully unleashing their power for e-commerce, in this paper, we construct ECInstruct, the first open-sourced, large-scale, and high-quality benchmark instruction dataset for e-commerce. Leveraging ECInstruct, we develop eCeLLM, a series of e-commerce LLMs, by instruction-tuning general-purpose LLMs. Our comprehensive experiments and evaluation demonstrate that eCeLLM models substantially outperform baseline models, including the most advanced GPT-4, and the state-of-the-art task-specific models in in-domain evaluation. Moreover, eCeLLM exhibits excellent generalizability to out-of-domain settings, including unseen products and unseen instructions, highlighting its superiority as a generalist e-commerce model. Both the ECInstruct dataset and the eCeLLM models show great potential in empowering versatile and effective LLMs for e-commerce.

In this paper, we focus on solving one of the most important tasks in the field of speech processing, i.e., automatic speech recognition (ASR), with speech foundation encoders and large language models (LLM). Recent works have complex designs such as compressing the output temporally for the speech encoder, tackling modal alignment for the projector, and utilizing parameter-efficient fine-tuning for the LLM. We found that delicate designs are not necessary, while an embarrassingly simple composition of off-the-shelf speech encoder, LLM, and the only trainable linear projector is competent for the ASR task. To be more specific, we benchmark and explore various combinations of LLMs and speech encoders, leading to the optimal LLM-based ASR system, which we call SLAM-ASR. The proposed SLAM-ASR provides a clean setup and little task-specific design, where only the linear projector is trained. To the best of our knowledge, SLAM-ASR achieves the best performance on the Librispeech benchmark among LLM-based ASR models and even outperforms the latest LLM-based audio-universal model trained on massive pair data. Finally, we explore the capability emergence of LLM-based ASR in the process of modal alignment. We hope that our study can facilitate the research on extending LLM with cross-modality capacity and shed light on the LLM-based ASR community.

While large language models (LLMs) excel at understanding and generating plain text, they are not specifically tailored to handle hierarchical text structures. Extracting the task-desired property from their natural language responses typically necessitates additional processing steps. In fact, selectively comprehending the hierarchical structure of large-scale text is pivotal to understanding its substance. Aligning LLMs more closely with the classification or regression values of specific task through prompting also remains challenging. To this end, we propose a novel framework called Tree-Based Hard Attention with Self-Motivation for Large Language Models (TEAROOM). TEAROOM incorporates a tree-based hard attention mechanism for LLMs to process hierarchically structured text inputs. By leveraging prompting, it enables a frozen LLM to selectively focus on relevant leaves in relation to the root, generating a tailored symbolic representation of their relationship.
Moreover, TEAROOM comprises a self-motivation strategy for another LLM equipped with a trainable adapter and a linear layer. The selected symbolic outcomes are integrated into another prompt, along with the predictive value of the task. We iteratively feed output values back into the prompt, enabling the trainable LLM to progressively approximate the golden truth. TEAROOM outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in experimental evaluations across three benchmark datasets, showing its effectiveness in estimating task-specific properties.
Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we have validated the ability of TEAROOM to gradually approach the underlying golden truth through multiple inferences.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns language models to human preferences by employing a singular reward model derived from preference data. However, such an approach overlooks the rich diversity of human preferences inherent in data collected from multiple users. In this work, we first derive an impossibility result of alignment with single reward RLHF, thereby highlighting its insufficiency in representing diverse human preferences. To provide an equitable solution to the problem, we learn a mixture of preference distributions via an expectation-maximization algorithm and propose a MaxMin alignment objective for policy learning inspired by the Egalitarian principle in social choice theory to better represent diverse human preferences. We elucidate the connection of our proposed approach to distributionally robust optimization and general utility RL, thereby highlighting the generality and robustness of our proposed solution. We present comprehensive experimental results on small-scale (GPT-2) and large-scale language models (with Tulu2-7B) and show the efficacy of the proposed approach in the presence of diversity among human preferences. Our algorithm achieves an average improvement of more than 16% in win-rates over conventional RLHF algorithms and improves the win-rate (accuracy) for minority groups by over 33% without compromising the performance of majority groups, showcasing the robustness and fairness of our approach. We remark that our findings in this work are not only limited to language models but also extend to reinforcement learning in general.

Automatic summarization of mass-emergency events plays a critical role in disaster management. The second edition of CrisisFACTS aims to advance disaster summarization based on multi-stream fact-finding with a focus on web sources such as Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, and Webnews. Here, participants are asked to develop systems that can extract key facts from several disaster-related events, which ultimately serve as a summary. This paper describes our method to tackle this challenging task. We follow previous work and propose to use a combination of retrieval, reranking, and an embarrassingly simple instruction-following summarization. The two-stage retrieval pipeline relies on BM25 and MonoT5, while the summarizer module is based on the open-source Large Language Model (LLM) LLaMA-13b. For summarization, we explore a Question Answering (QA)-motivated prompting approach and find the evidence useful for extracting query-relevant facts. The automatic metrics and human evaluation show strong results but also highlight the gap between open-source and proprietary systems.

The rapid development in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a surge in applications that facilitate collaboration among multiple agents to assist humans in their daily tasks. However, a significant gap remains in assessing whether LLM-powered applications genuinely enhance user experience and task execution efficiency. This highlights the pressing need for methods to verify utility of LLM-powered applications, particularly by ensuring alignment between the application's functionality and end-user needs. We introduce AgentEval provides an implementation for the math problems}, a novel framework designed to simplify the utility verification process by automatically proposing a set of criteria tailored to the unique purpose of any given application. This allows for a comprehensive assessment, quantifying the utility of an application against the suggested criteria. We present a comprehensive analysis of the robustness of quantifier's work.

Large language models (LLMs) have proven to be highly effective across various natural language processing tasks. However, their large number of parameters poses significant challenges for practical deployment. Pruning, a technique aimed at reducing the size and complexity of LLMs, offers a potential solution by removing redundant components from the network. Despite the promise of pruning, existing methods often struggle to achieve substantial end-to-end LLM inference speedup. In this paper, we introduce SLEB, a novel approach designed to streamline LLMs by eliminating redundant transformer blocks. We choose the transformer block as the fundamental unit for pruning, because LLMs exhibit block-level redundancy with high similarity between the outputs of neighboring blocks. This choice allows us to effectively enhance the processing speed of LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that SLEB successfully accelerates LLM inference without compromising the linguistic capabilities of these models, making it a promising technique for optimizing the efficiency of LLMs. The code is available at: https://github.com/leapingjagg-dev/SLEB

Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in code-related tasks. Several instruction tuning approaches have been proposed to boost the code generation performance of pre-trained Code LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a diverse instruction model (DolphCoder) with self-evaluating for code generation. It learns diverse instruction targets and combines a code evaluation objective to enhance its code generation ability.
Our model achieves superior performance on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, demonstrating new insights for future code instruction tuning work. Our key findings are: (1) Augmenting more diverse responses with distinct reasoning paths increases the code capability of LLMs. (2) Improving one's ability to evaluate the correctness of code solutions also enhances their ability to create it.

Do large language models (LLMs) display rational reasoning? LLMs have been shown to contain human biases due to the data they have been trained on; whether this is reflected in rational reasoning remains less clear. In this paper, we answer this question by evaluating seven language models using tasks from the cognitive psychology literature. We find that, like humans, LLMs display irrationality in these tasks. However, the way this irrationality is displayed does not reflect that shown by humans. When incorrect answers are given by LLMs to these tasks, they are often incorrect in ways that differ from human-like biases. On top of this, the LLMs reveal an additional layer of irrationality in the significant inconsistency of the responses. Aside from the experimental results, this paper seeks to make a methodological contribution by showing how we can assess and compare different capabilities of these types of models, in this case with respect to rational reasoning.

With the rapidly increasing application of large language models (LLMs), their abuse has caused many undesirable societal problems such as fake news, academic dishonesty, and information pollution. This makes AI-generated text (AIGT) detection of great importance. Among existing methods, white-box methods are generally superior to black-box methods in terms of performance and generalizability, but they require access to LLMs' internal states and are not applicable to black-box settings. In this paper, we propose to estimate word generation probabilities as pseudo white-box features via multiple re-sampling to help improve AIGT detection under the black-box setting. Specifically, we design POGER, a proxy-guided efficient re-sampling method, which selects a small subset of representative words (e.g., 10 words) for performing multiple re-sampling in black-box AIGT detection. Experiments on datasets containing texts from humans and seven LLMs show that POGER outperforms all baselines in macro F1 under black-box, partial white-box, and out-of-distribution settings and maintains lower re-sampling costs than its existing counterparts.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have found several use cases in education, ranging from automatic question generation to essay evaluation. In this paper, we explore the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to author Intelligent Tutoring Systems. A common pitfall of LLMs is their straying from desired pedagogical strategies such as leaking the answer to the student, and in general, providing no guarantees. We posit that while LLMs with certain guardrails can take the place of subject experts, the overall pedagogical design still needs to be handcrafted for the best learning results. Based on this principle, we create a sample end-to-end tutoring system named MWPTutor, which uses LLMs to fill in the state space of a pre-defined finite state transducer. This approach retains the structure and the pedagogy of traditional tutoring systems that has been developed over the years by learning scientists but brings in additional flexibility of LLM-based approaches. Through a human evaluation study on two datasets based on math word problems, we show that our hybrid approach achieves a better overall tutoring score than an instructed, but otherwise free-form, GPT-4. MWPTutor is completely modular and opens up the scope for the community to improve its performance by improving individual modules or using different teaching strategies that it can follow

To harness the power of large language models in safety-critical domains we need to ensure the explainability of their predictions. However, despite the significant attention to model interpretability, there remains an unexplored domain in explaining sequence-to-sequence tasks using methods tailored for textual data. This paper introduces SyntaxShap, a local, model-agnostic explainability method for text generation that takes into consideration the syntax in the text data. The presented work extends Shapley values to account for parsing-based syntactic dependencies. Taking a game theoric approach, SyntaxShap only considers coalitions constraint by the dependency tree. We adopt a model-based evaluation to compare SyntaxShap and its weighted form to state-of-the-art explainability methods adapted to text generation tasks, using diverse metrics including faithfulness, complexity, coherency, and semantic alignment of the explanations to the model. We show that our syntax-aware method produces explanations that help build more faithful, coherent, and interpretable explanations for predictions by autoregressive models.

Despite showing increasingly human-like abilities, large language models (LLMs) often struggle with factual inaccuracies, i.e. "hallucinations", even when they hold relevant knowledge. To address these hallucinations, current approaches typically necessitate high-quality human factuality annotations. In this work, we explore Self-Alignment for Factuality, where we leverage the self-evaluation capability of an LLM to provide training signals that steer the model towards factuality. Specifically, we incorporate Self-Eval, a self-evaluation component, to prompt an LLM to validate the factuality of its own generated responses solely based on its internal knowledge. Additionally, we design Self-Knowledge Tuning (SK-Tuning) to augment the LLM's self-evaluation ability by improving the model's confidence estimation and calibration. We then utilize these self-annotated responses to fine-tune the model via Direct Preference Optimization algorithm. We show that the proposed self-alignment approach substantially enhances factual accuracy over Llama family models across three key knowledge-intensive tasks on TruthfulQA and BioGEN.

Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks in recent years. However, their universal nature poses limitations in scenarios requiring personalized responses, such as recommendation systems and chatbots. This paper investigates methods to personalize LLMs, comparing fine-tuning and zero-shot reasoning approaches on subjective tasks. Results demonstrate that personalized fine-tuning improves model reasoning compared to non-personalized models. Experiments on datasets for emotion recognition and hate speech detection show consistent performance gains with personalized methods across different LLM architectures. These findings underscore the importance of personalization for enhancing LLM capabilities in subjective text perception tasks.

The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 into traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks has opened new avenues for enhancing model performance while reducing the reliance on extensive human annotations.
This paper presents a novel approach that leverages the Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting technique to distill knowledge from GPT-4, subsequently applying it to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a smaller model, BERT, on Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. Our method involves a two-phase training process: initially employing GPT-4 annotated data for pre-training and then refining the model with a combination of distilled and original human-annotated data. The results demonstrate that our mixed-training strategy significantly outperforms models trained solely on human annotations, achieving superior F1-scores and showcasing a cost-effective solution for resource-limited or closed-network settings. The study also discusses the challenges encountered, such as LLM output variability and the tendency towards hallucinations, proposing future work directions to enhance prompt design and annotation selection. Our findings indicate a promising synergy between LLM insights and traditional NLP techniques, paving the way for more accessible and robust NLP applications.

Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on Human Preference Alignment (HPA) to ensure the generation of safe content. Due to the heavy cost associated with fine-tuning, fine-tuning-free methods have emerged, typically modifying LLM decoding with external auxiliary methods. However, these methods do not essentially enhance the LLM itself. In this paper, we rethink the derivation procedures of DPO, based on which we conversely build an instant scorer using the states of the LLM before and after In-context Learning (ICL). Accordingly, we propose a novel approach called In-Context Direct Preference Optimization (ICDPO). It enables LLMs to borrow the HPA capabilities from superior LLMs with ICL, generating well-aligned responses as estimated by the aforementioned instant scorer, thereby enhancing the final performance. ICDPO can be further enhanced with a two-stage retriever and an upgraded scorer, both offering benefits. Extensive experiments show its effectiveness, particularly in outperforming two fine-tuning-free baselines, and it exhibits competitiveness with SFT + LoRA. We also conduct detailed analyses to offer comprehensive insights into ICDPO.

Questions of fair use of copyright-protected content to train Large Language Models (LLMs) are being very actively debated. Document-level inference has been proposed as a new task: inferring from black-box access to the trained model whether a piece of content has been seen during training. SOTA methods however rely on naturally occurring memorization of (part of) the content.
While very effective against models that memorize a lot, we hypothesize--and later confirm--that they will not work against models that do not naturally memorize, e.g. medium-size 1B models. We here propose to use copyright traps, the inclusion of fictitious entries in original content, to detect the use of copyrighted materials in LLMs with a focus on models where memorization does not naturally occur. We carefully design an experimental setup, randomly inserting traps into original content (books) and train a 1.3B LLM. We first validate that the use of content in our target model would be undetectable using existing methods. We then show, contrary to intuition, that even medium-length trap sentences repeated a significant number of times (100) are not detectable using existing methods. However, we show that longer sequences repeated a large number of times can be reliably detected (AUC=0.75) and used as copyright traps. We further improve these results by studying how the number of times a sequence is seen improves detectability, how sequences with higher perplexity tend to be memorized more, and how taking context into account further improves detectability.

Pretrained large language models have revolutionized many applications but still face challenges related to cultural bias and a lack of cultural commonsense knowledge crucial for guiding cross-culture communication and interactions. Recognizing the shortcomings of existing methods in capturing the diverse and rich cultures across the world, this paper introduces a novel approach for massively multicultural knowledge acquisition. Specifically, our method strategically navigates from densely informative Wikipedia documents on cultural topics to an extensive network of linked pages. Leveraging this valuable source of data collection, we construct the CultureAtlas dataset, which covers a wide range of sub-country level geographical regions and ethnolinguistic groups, with data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure textual assertion sentence self-containment, as well as fine-grained cultural profile information extraction. Our dataset not only facilitates the evaluation of language model performance in culturally diverse contexts but also serves as a foundational tool for the development of culturally sensitive and aware language models. Our work marks an important step towards deeper understanding and bridging the gaps of cultural disparities in AI, to promote a more inclusive and balanced representation of global cultures in the digital domain.

This paper introduces AQA-Bench, a novel benchmark to assess the sequential reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in algorithmic contexts, such as depth-first search (DFS). The key feature of our evaluation benchmark lies in its interactive evaluation protocol -- for example, in DFS, the availability of each node's connected edge is contingent upon the model's traversal to that node, thereby necessitating the LLM's ability to effectively remember visited nodes and strategize subsequent moves. We comprehensively build AQA-Bench with three different algorithms, namely binary search, depth-first search, and breadth-first search, and to evaluate the sequential reasoning ability of 12 different LLMs. Our investigations reveal several interesting findings: (1) Closed-source models like GPT-4 and Gemini generally show strong sequential reasoning ability, significantly outperforming open-source LLMs. (2) Naively providing interactive examples may inadvertently hurt few-shot performance. (3) A very limited number of predecessor steps following the optimal policy can substantially boost small models' performance.
(4) The scaling correlation between performance and model size is not always significant, sometimes even showcasing an inverse trend. We hope our study can catalyze future work on advancing the understanding and enhancement of LLMs' capabilities in sequential reasoning.

We explore machine unlearning (MU) in the domain of large language models (LLMs), referred to as LLM unlearning. This initiative aims to eliminate undesirable data influence (e.g., sensitive or illegal information) and the associated model capabilities, while maintaining the integrity of essential knowledge generation and not affecting causally unrelated information. We envision LLM unlearning becoming a pivotal element in the life-cycle management of LLMs, potentially standing as an essential foundation for developing generative AI that is not only safe, secure, and trustworthy, but also resource-efficient without the need of full retraining. We navigate the unlearning landscape in LLMs from conceptual formulation, methodologies, metrics, and applications. In particular, we highlight the often-overlooked aspects of existing LLM unlearning research, e.g., unlearning scope, data-model interaction, and multifaceted efficacy assessment. We also draw connections between LLM unlearning and related areas such as model editing, influence functions, model explanation, adversarial training, and reinforcement learning.
Furthermore, we outline an effective assessment framework for LLM unlearning and explore its applications in copyright and privacy safeguards and sociotechnical harm reduction.

Current research in adversarial robustness of LLMs focuses on discrete input manipulations in the natural language space, which can be directly transferred to closed-source models. However, this approach neglects the steady progression of open-source models. As open-source models advance in capability, ensuring their safety also becomes increasingly imperative. Yet, attacks tailored to open-source LLMs that exploit full model access remain largely unexplored. We address this research gap and propose the embedding space attack, which directly attacks the continuous embedding representation of input tokens. We find that embedding space attacks circumvent model alignments and trigger harmful behaviors more efficiently than discrete attacks or model fine-tuning.
Furthermore, we present a novel threat model in the context of unlearning and show that embedding space attacks can extract supposedly deleted information from unlearned LLMs across multiple datasets and models. Our findings highlight embedding space attacks as an important threat model in open-source LLMs.

Current LLM alignment methods are readily broken through specifically crafted adversarial prompts. While crafting adversarial prompts using discrete optimization is highly effective, such attacks typically use more than 100,000 LLM calls. This high computational cost makes them unsuitable for, e.g., quantitative analyses and adversarial training. To remedy this, we revisit Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) on the continuously relaxed input prompt.
Although previous attempts with ordinary gradient-based attacks largely failed, we show that carefully controlling the error introduced by the continuous relaxation tremendously boosts their efficacy. Our PGD for LLMs is up to one order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art discrete optimization to achieve the same devastating attack results.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to Jailbreaking attacks, which aim to extract harmful information by subtly modifying the attack query. As defense mechanisms evolve, directly obtaining harmful information becomes increasingly challenging for Jailbreaking attacks. In this work, inspired by human practices of indirect context to elicit harmful information, we focus on a new attack form called Contextual Interaction Attack. The idea relies on the autoregressive nature of the generation process in LLMs. We contend that the prior context--the information preceding the attack query--plays a pivotal role in enabling potent Jailbreaking attacks. Specifically, we propose an approach that leverages preliminary question-answer pairs to interact with the LLM. By doing so, we guide the responses of the model toward revealing the 'desired' harmful information. We conduct experiments on four different LLMs and demonstrate the efficacy of this attack, which is black-box and can also transfer across LLMs. We believe this can lead to further developments and understanding of the context vector in LLMs.

To build intelligent machine learning systems, there are two broad approaches. One approach is to build inherently interpretable models, as endeavored by the growing field of causal representation learning. The other approach is to build highly-performant foundation models and then invest efforts into understanding how they work. In this work, we relate these two approaches and study how to learn human-interpretable concepts from data.
Weaving together ideas from both fields, we formally define a notion of concepts and show that they can be provably recovered from diverse data.
Experiments on synthetic data and large language models show the utility of our unified approach.

Autoregressive decoding with generative Large Language Models (LLMs) on accelerators (GPUs/TPUs) is often memory-bound where most of the time is spent on transferring model parameters from high bandwidth memory (HBM) to cache. On the other hand, recent works show that LLMs can maintain quality with significant sparsity/redundancy in the feedforward (FFN) layers by appropriately training the model to operate on a top-$k$ fraction of rows/columns (where $k \approx 0.05$), there by suggesting a way to reduce the transfer of model parameters, and hence latency. However, exploiting this sparsity for improving latency is hindered by the fact that identifying top rows/columns is data-dependent and is usually performed using full matrix operations, severely limiting potential gains. To address these issues, we introduce HiRE (High Recall Approximate Top-k Estimation). HiRE comprises of two novel components: (i) a compression scheme to cheaply predict top-$k$ rows/columns with high recall, followed by full computation restricted to the predicted subset, and (ii) DA-TOP-$k$: an efficient multi-device approximate top-$k$ operator. We demonstrate that on a one billion parameter model, HiRE applied to both the softmax as well as feedforward layers, achieves almost matching pretraining and downstream accuracy, and speeds up inference latency by $1.47\times$ on a single TPUv5e device.

Many computational factors limit broader deployment of large language models.
In this paper, we focus on a memory bottleneck imposed by the key-value (KV) cache, a computational shortcut that requires storing previous KV pairs during decoding. While existing KV cache methods approach this problem by pruning or evicting large swaths of relatively less important KV pairs to dramatically reduce the memory footprint of the cache, they can have limited success in tasks that require recollecting a majority of previous tokens. To alleviate this issue, we propose LESS, a simple integration of a (nearly free) constant sized cache with eviction-based cache methods, such that all tokens can be queried at later decoding steps. Its ability to retain information throughout time shows merit on a variety of tasks where we demonstrate LESS can help reduce the performance gap from caching everything, sometimes even matching it, all while being efficient.

Aligning large language models (LLM) with human preference plays a key role in building modern generative models and can be achieved by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Despite their superior performance, current RLHF approaches often require a large amount of human-labelled preference data, which is expensive to collect. In this paper, inspired by the success of active learning, we address this problem by proposing query-efficient RLHF methods. We first formalize the alignment problem as a contextual dueling bandit problem and design an active-query-based proximal policy optimization (APPO) algorithm with an $\tilde{O}(d^2/\Delta)$ regret bound and an $\tilde{O}(d^2/\Delta^2)$ query complexity, where $d$ is the dimension of feature space and $\Delta$ is the sub-optimality gap over all the contexts. We then propose ADPO, a practical version of our algorithm based on direct preference optimization (DPO) and apply it to fine-tuning LLMs. Our experiments show that ADPO, while only making about half of queries for human preference, matches the performance of the state-of-the-art DPO method.

Music is an inherently social activity that allows people to share experiences and feel connected with one another. There has been little progress in designing artificial partners exhibiting a similar social experience as playing with another person. Neural network architectures that implement generative models, such as large language models, are suited for producing musical scores. Playing music socially, however, involves more than playing a score; it must complement the other musicians' ideas and keep time correctly.
We addressed the question of whether a convincing social experience is made possible by a generative model trained to produce musical scores, not necessarily optimized for synchronization and continuation. The network, a variational autoencoder trained on a large corpus of digital scores, was adapted for a timed call-and-response task with a human partner. Participants played piano with a human or artificial partner-in various configurations-and rated the performance quality and first-person experience of self-other integration. Overall, the artificial partners held promise but were rated lower than human partners. The artificial partner with simplest design and highest similarity parameter was not rated differently from the human partners on some measures, suggesting that interactive rather than generative sophistication is important in enabling social AI.

Since its release in November 2022, ChatGPT has shaken up Stack Overflow, the premier platform for developers' queries on programming and software development. Demonstrating an ability to generate instant, human-like responses to technical questions, ChatGPT has ignited debates within the developer community about the evolving role of human-driven platforms in the age of generative AI. Two months after ChatGPT's release, Meta released its answer with its own Large Language Model (LLM) called LLaMA: the race was on. We conducted an empirical study analyzing questions from Stack Overflow and using these LLMs to address them. This way, we aim to (ii) measure user engagement evolution with Stack Overflow over time; (ii) quantify the reliability of LLMs' answers and their potential to replace Stack Overflow in the long term; (iii) identify and understand why LLMs fails; and (iv) compare LLMs together. Our empirical results are unequivocal: ChatGPT and LLaMA challenge human expertise, yet do not outperform it for some domains, while a significant decline in user posting activity has been observed. Furthermore, we also discuss the impact of our findings regarding the usage and development of new LLMs.

Large language models (LLMs) are becoming more prevalent and have found a ubiquitous use in providing different forms of writing assistance. However, LLM-powered writing systems can frustrate users due to their limited personalization and control, which can be exacerbated when users lack experience with prompt engineering. We see design as one way to address these challenges and introduce GhostWriter, an AI-enhanced writing design probe where users can exercise enhanced agency and personalization. GhostWriter leverages LLMs to learn the user's intended writing style implicitly as they write, while allowing explicit teaching moments through manual style edits and annotations.
We study 18 participants who use GhostWriter on two different writing tasks, observing that it helps users craft personalized text generations and empowers them by providing multiple ways to control the system's writing style. From this study, we present insights regarding people's relationship with AI-assisted writing and offer design recommendations for future work.

As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world applications such as code generation and chatbot assistance, extensive efforts have been made to align LLM behavior with human values, including safety. Jailbreak attacks, aiming to provoke unintended and unsafe behaviors from LLMs, remain a significant/leading LLM safety threat. In this paper, we aim to defend LLMs against jailbreak attacks by introducing SafeDecoding, a safety-aware decoding strategy for LLMs to generate helpful and harmless responses to user queries. Our insight in developing SafeDecoding is based on the observation that, even though probabilities of tokens representing harmful contents outweigh those representing harmless responses, safety disclaimers still appear among the top tokens after sorting tokens by probability in descending order. This allows us to mitigate jailbreak attacks by identifying safety disclaimers and amplifying their token probabilities, while simultaneously attenuating the probabilities of token sequences that are aligned with the objectives of jailbreak attacks. We perform extensive experiments on five LLMs using six state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks and four benchmark datasets. Our results show that SafeDecoding significantly reduces the attack success rate and harmfulness of jailbreak attacks without compromising the helpfulness of responses to benign user queries. SafeDecoding outperforms six defense methods.

Recently, Large Language Model based Autonomous system(LLMAS) has gained great popularity for its potential to simulate complicated behaviors of human societies. One of its main challenges is to present and analyze the dynamic events evolution of LLMAS. In this work, we present a visualization approach to explore detailed statuses and agents' behavior within LLMAS. We propose a general pipeline that establishes a behavior structure from raw LLMAS execution events, leverages a behavior summarization algorithm to construct a hierarchical summary of the entire structure in terms of time sequence, and a cause trace method to mine the causal relationship between agent behaviors. We then develop AgentLens, a visual analysis system that leverages a hierarchical temporal visualization for illustrating the evolution of LLMAS, and supports users to interactively investigate details and causes of agents' behaviors. Two usage scenarios and a user study demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our AgentLens.

With the development of LLMs, the security threats of LLMs are getting more and more attention. Numerous jailbreak attacks have been proposed to assess the security defense of LLMs. Current jailbreak attacks primarily utilize scenario camouflage techniques. However their explicitly mention of malicious intent will be easily recognized and defended by LLMs. In this paper, we propose an indirect jailbreak attack approach, Puzzler, which can bypass the LLM's defense strategy and obtain malicious response by implicitly providing LLMs with some clues about the original malicious query. In addition, inspired by the wisdom of ''When unable to attack, defend'' from Sun Tzu's Art of War, we adopt a defensive stance to gather clues about the original malicious query through LLMs. Extensive experimental results show that Puzzler achieves a query success rate of 96.6% on closed-source LLMs, which is 57.9%-82.7% higher than baselines. Furthermore, when tested against the state-of-the-art jailbreak detection approaches, Puzzler proves to be more effective at evading detection compared to baselines.

To evaluate code large language models (LLMs), research has relied on a few small manually curated benchmarks, such as HumanEval and MBPP, which represent a narrow part of the real-world software domains. In this work, we introduce round-trip correctness (RTC) as an alternative evaluation method. RTC allows Code LLM evaluation on a broader spectrum of real-world software domains without the need for costly human curation. RTC rests on the idea that we can ask a model to make a prediction (e.g., describe some code using natural language), feed that prediction back (e.g., synthesize code from the predicted description), and check if this round-trip leads to code that is semantically equivalent to the original input. We show how to employ RTC to evaluate code synthesis and editing. We find that RTC strongly correlates with model performance on existing narrow-domain code synthesis benchmarks while allowing us to expand to a much broader set of domains and tasks which was not previously possible without costly human annotations.

The increasing demand for customized Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of solutions like GPTs. These solutions facilitate tailored LLM creation via natural language prompts without coding. However, the trustworthiness of third-party custom versions of LLMs remains an essential concern. In this paper, we propose the first instruction backdoor attacks against applications integrated with untrusted customized LLMs (e.g., GPTs).
Specifically, these attacks embed the backdoor into the custom version of LLMs by designing prompts with backdoor instructions, outputting the attacker's desired result when inputs contain the pre-defined triggers. Our attack includes 3 levels of attacks: word-level, syntax-level, and semantic-level, which adopt different types of triggers with progressive stealthiness. We stress that our attacks do not require fine-tuning or any modification to the backend LLMs, adhering strictly to GPTs development guidelines. We conduct extensive experiments on 4 prominent LLMs and 5 benchmark text classification datasets. The results show that our instruction backdoor attacks achieve the desired attack performance without compromising utility. Additionally, we propose an instruction-ignoring defense mechanism and demonstrate its partial effectiveness in mitigating such attacks. Our findings highlight the vulnerability and the potential risks of LLM customization such as GPTs.

Code auditing ensures that the developed code adheres to standards, regulations, and copyright protection by verifying that it does not contain code from protected sources. The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) as coding assistants in the software development process poses new challenges for code auditing. The dataset for training these models is mainly collected from publicly available sources. This raises the issue of intellectual property infringement as developers' codes are already included in the dataset.
Therefore, auditing code developed using LLMs is challenging, as it is difficult to reliably assert if an LLM used during development has been trained on specific copyrighted codes, given that we do not have access to the training datasets of these models. Given the non-disclosure of the training datasets, traditional approaches such as code clone detection are insufficient for asserting copyright infringement. To address this challenge, we propose a new approach, TraWiC; a model-agnostic and interpretable method based on membership inference for detecting code inclusion in an LLM's training dataset. We extract syntactic and semantic identifiers unique to each program to train a classifier for detecting code inclusion. In our experiments, we observe that TraWiC is capable of detecting 83.87% of codes that were used to train an LLM. In comparison, the prevalent clone detection tool NiCad is only capable of detecting 47.64%. In addition to its remarkable performance, TraWiC has low resource overhead in contrast to pair-wise clone detection that is conducted during the auditing process of tools like CodeWhisperer reference tracker, across thousands of code snippets.
